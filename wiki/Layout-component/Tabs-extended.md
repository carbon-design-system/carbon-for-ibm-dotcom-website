[[Tabs extended]] extends the [[Carbon tabs]] component by adding the accordion to smaller breakpoints. This extension in feature allows the content to be more accessible at smaller breakpoints and mobile users.

### 1. Children

The children can have anything placed inside of it from content to another component as seen in [[Tabs extended media]]. The children are shared across the [[Carbon tabs]], and [[Carbon accordion]] across all breakpoints. Each tab item, and related accordion item has an area for its own children.

### 2. Tabs

The tabs leverages [[Carbon tabs]] as is for the most part as a dependency, and passes its corresponding children <sup>[[1](#1-children)]</sup> for that tab. The only differences are listed below. Children <sup>[[1](#1-children)]</sup>, and tab titles mirror accordion, and is only visible at larger breakpoints.

###### Logic

| | condition | description |
|:--- |:--------- |:----------- |
| `2.0.1` | `lg` `xlg` `max` | Any breakpoint `lg` and larger renders the [[Carbon tabs]] |
| `2.0.2` | `sm` `md` | Any breakpoint `md` and smaller hides the [[Carbon tabs]] |

#### 2.1 Item

###### Logic

| | condition | description |
|:--- |:--------- |:----------- |
| `2.1.1` | content overflows at 2 lines | Content overflows at 2 lines instead of the components original 1 line overflow.  |
| `2.1.2` | removed fixed width | Tab width is based on content, and should not have a fixed width.  |
| `2.1.3` | `active` | First item active `onLoad` unless author overrides. Mirrors accordion's <sup>[[3](#3-accordion)]</sup> active state as user interacts.  |

<br />

#### 2.2 Orientation

###### Logic

| | condition | description |
|:--- |:--------- |:----------- |
| `2.2.1` | `horizontal (default)` | By default, or when this option is selected this component lays its tabs out in a horizontal line next to each other with children <sup>[[1](#1-children)]</sup> below. |
| `2.2.2` | `vertical` | When the `vertical` option is selected the tabs are stacked on top of each other off to the side of its children <sup>[[1](#1-children)]</sup>. |

### 3. Accordion

The accordion uses the [[Carbon accordion]] as a dependency without hardly any changes. This is used at the smaller breakpoints to allow for better reading of tabs on smaller devices, and mirrors the children <sup>[[1](#1-children)]</sup> and active tabs within the tab <sup>[[2](#2-tabs)]</sup> at larger breakpoints.

###### Logic

| | condition | description |
|:--- |:--------- |:----------- |
| `3.0.1` | `lg` `xlg` `max` | Any breakpoint `lg` and larger hides the [[Carbon accordion]] |
| `3.0.2` | `sm` `md` | Any breakpoint `md` and smaller renders the [[Carbon accordion]] |

<br />

#### 3.1 Item

###### Logic

| | condition | description |
|:--- |:--------- |:----------- |
| `3.1.1` | `active` | First item active `onLoad` unless author overrides. Mirrors tabs' <sup>[[2](#2-tabs)]</sup> active state as user interacts. Only one active item at a time.  |
