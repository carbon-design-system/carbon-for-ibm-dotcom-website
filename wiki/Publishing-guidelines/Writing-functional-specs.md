The functional specs document describes a component’s capabilities, appearance,
and interactions. It also explains how a component should be named, broken down,
and reused by other components.

### How it's used

The functional specs serve as the source of truth for all aspects of a component
and operates as a written agreement between design and development.

- Design will use functional specs to communicate their design intent, and iron
  out edge cases.
- Development will often use the functional specs to build the component based
  on requirements.
- QA will use the document to validate whether something is a bug or not.
- It’s also used by other teams for content strategy planning and more.

### Basic principles

Apply these basic principles to your functional analysis and specs. These
principles can be used to help you and your teammates build a scalable component
within the larger system.

- **Start early in your team's process**: Attend meetings, listen, be involved,
  take notes. If you start too late in the process you risk becoming a
  bottleneck, and revising old decisions that should have never been made.
- **Collaborate across disciplines**: Functional analysis and specs sit at the
  intersection of design, development, and even business. It fills a gap, and is
  intended to help improve the collaboration between these disciplines. In
  addition to that, the functional analyst should help facilitate discussions,
  and bring the different disciplines together into the same room to
  collaborate. This type of diverse thinking early on will help you find the
  most ideal solution for the system, and many of its edge cases, earlier in the
  process. Do not write functional specs in a silo.
- **Reuse existing components**: Always look at what you have to build from
  before creating new components. Many times an existing component will fit your
  new scenario with a subset of its features. Next, look at changing only a
  couple small things in an existing component to allow for a new use case. If
  it results in something that is overengineered, or if it doesn't make sense to
  fit into any existing components then consider creating a new component.
- **Avoid duplication and redundancy**: Do not write functionality out in
  _Component A_ when _Component B_ already outlines that same functionality.
  Otherwise we have to remember to go back and update _Component A_ when we're
  updating that _Component B_ functionality. Instead just link out to _Component
  B_ for the reader to reference, and only outline fixed values applied to that
  component. If you find yourself documenting the same functionality across
  multiple components consider creating a new component, or utility.
- **Think about edge cases**: Edge cases are easy to neglect because they are
  hard to imagine sometimes. This is often because it takes a different way of
  thinking or new perspective to identify them. You may not catch every single
  nuance, but it's important to put a lot of time and thought into imagining
  scenarios not specifically called out in the design process, and either
  documenting them in the functional specs or asking design to find a solution.
  If we do not work to solve for this in the design and functional spec stages,
  then development is usually left to solve it on their own.
- **A component should do one thing very well**: A component shouldn't do too
  much, and neither should its functional specs. When we add too much
  functionality to a single component it becomes bloated. The code and
  documentation becomes hard to understand, performance tends to go down, and
  the opportunity for bugs increases dramatically. If you find things are
  getting out of hand, and your functional spec document is becoming too long
  and complicated that could be a sign you need to break it down into smaller
  components.
- **Don't overengineer**: To help balance the last point, we don't want to
  overdo it. Don't start breaking a component down before you understand what's
  going on. Sometimes by looking too far into the future you're creating extra
  work for yourself both now, and in the future. Also teams often times want
  complicated solutions that burden a component unnecessarily. It's the
  functional analyst's job to watch for when we might be starting to
  overengineer a component's solution, and then help push back and simplify it.
- **Document with consistency**: When documenting a component it's easy to write
  _Component A_ one way, and maybe someone else comes in to document _Component
  B_ a different way. It's important to be as consistent as we can be in format,
  and language used. Start with the [naming strategy](#how-to-name-components),
  [data models](#data-model), [templates](#understanding-the-template) and other
  guidelines we have available. If something isn't working then we can have a
  conversation about either how to shape the documentation correctly, or how we
  can iterate on the guidelines to fit our needs as they grow.

### How to name components

The
[Component naming standard](https://ibm.box.com/s/xlq4romcyp50lnvwuaagyzzbmmesuxen)
provides guiding principles for naming components based on their anatomy,
hierarchy, and appearance. Naming components in a consistent way ensures
recognition and increases a component's findability by users of the system.

### Data model

The [[Data model]] is a shared architecture of content across all of our
components, and should be used as a starting point when structuring new
components or updating existing components.

<br /><br />

## Understanding the template

The [[Functional spec template]] includes the sections most commonly needed to
document our components. Using a common format drives consistency across our
library and makes it easier for everyone to use. Use only the sections you need
and if there’s a better way to present a particular component, we can review and
change as necessary.

> here is a link to the functional specs template: [[Functional spec template]]

<br />

### Meta data

The meta data helps the reader find what they are looking for while also
providing the team with the language and breakdown of how a component is formed.
Some of these items are autogenerated, while others are added manually.

Categorization tagging like `layout` or `service` at the top of the document is
autogenerated based on what folder the functional spec is saved to. Additional
tags like `decorator` or `core` must be added manually.

#### Table of contents

The table of contents is autogenerated. Make sure the table of contents section
template is included in your component wiki page. With correct markdown
headings, the page outline will automatically appear where you place the
template section.

#### Dependencies

The dependency list is one of the most important aspects of the functional
specs. It communicates to the developer what components should be used when
building out a component. It's a key part of the written agreement between
design and development about what the component is, looks like, and does.

###### How to add a dependency

1. Find the dependency list in your component's template.
2. Add a new list item.
3. Link to the component using the Wiki linking strategy.

<details>
  <summary><strong>Example</strong></summary><br />

```html
- [[Component or wiki page name 1]] - [[Component or wiki page name 2]] -
[[Component or wiki page name 3]]
```

> ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3793636/117873919-f6faba80-b265-11eb-81a5-039bdcd822e8.png)
> Notice the double brackets with the file name `[[File name]]` in-between. This
> is different from a markdown link `[text](url)`.

<br />
</details><br /><br />

#### Used by

The used by components section communicates to the reader where this component
is used in other components. As long as you include this section, and properly
link to it in other components' [dependencies](#dependencies) then this list
will create itself.

###### How to add a used by

> ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3793636/117873919-f6faba80-b265-11eb-81a5-039bdcd822e8.png)
> Keep [dependencies](#dependencies) up to date, and leverage
> [used by](#used-by) template section in the component wiki page.

#### Backlinks

When a wiki document references another component, it creates a backlink.
Backlinks are autogenerated and are listed by page, along with a snippet of text
from the page for context. The links take you directly to the mention on the
page.

> ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3793636/117873919-f6faba80-b265-11eb-81a5-039bdcd822e8.png)
> Use double bracket `[[Document name]]` MediaWiki syntax to get proper link
> backs at this moment.

#### Resources

The resource section is a numbered list of additional resources not included in
the [dependency list](#dependencies). For example design specs, box folders,
prototypes, and any additional documentation that will be helpful. Follow the
numbering standard to stay consistent (`r` for resources, and `#` in the list).
If you need to remove an item, it's best to keep its number the same. Skipping
numbers in this scenario is okay, and preferred as there could be cross page
linking.

<details>
  <summary><strong>Example</strong></summary><br />

```html
- r1: [resource example](www.example.com) - r2: [resource
example](www.example.com) - r3: [resource example](www.example.com) - r6:
[resource example](www.example.com) - r7: [resource example](www.example.com)
```

<br />
</details><br /><br />

### Sections

The following sections provide a structure for the information required for
component development. Using this same structure provides consistency across
documents and ease of use for all stakeholders. If there are adjustments needed
for your component, we can review and discuss the best approach.

<br /><br />

#### Global

Use Global to include a visual of the component, and a high-level breakdown of
its elements and components. Depending on the needs of the component, it may be
helpful to include one or more global [option tables](#table-options) to
demonstrate how the whole component's functionality can be modified.

#### Level 1

Level 1 typically outlines the highest layer of elements within a component,
along with any dependencies. This is where you identify what pieces are
`optional`, and what `type` (e.g. `string`, `component`) it might be. Use this
section to break the component down further, or add functional details, as
needed.

> ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3793636/117873919-f6faba80-b265-11eb-81a5-039bdcd822e8.png)
> The title here is typically `###` an `h3`.

#### Level 2

Level 2 can be more of the same as [Level 1](#level-1) but in more detail as
needed. There are usually one or more [table options](#table-options) to
document the detailed functionality. Most of the time this is where the
breakdown ends.

> ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3793636/117873919-f6faba80-b265-11eb-81a5-039bdcd822e8.png)
> The title here is typically `####` an `h4`.

#### Level 3

Level 3 is rarely used, and usually only in some of the most complicated
components we have. Even then, if you're reaching level 3 you should probably be
reconsidering your approach.

> ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3793636/117873919-f6faba80-b265-11eb-81a5-039bdcd822e8.png)
> The title here is typically `#####` an `h5`.

<br /><br />

#### Anatomy visual

The anatomy is added as a high level annotated image within the
[global section](#global). Oftentimes it dictates the structure/outline of the
functional specs. The annotations reference heading numbers that detail a given
aspect of the component. If more detail is needed, it's possible to break the
component into annotated sections, and at [level 2](#level-2) provided a more
detailed annotated anatomy image for reference. The anatomy section fulfills two
important functions: it orients the reader visually with the component, and sets
up the structure of the information to follow, making it easier to read and
comprehend.

> ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3793636/117873919-f6faba80-b265-11eb-81a5-039bdcd822e8.png)
> It's important to keep these visuals up to date, but they may become outdated
> over time and as long as the anatomy hasn't changed much, this is okay. The
> design specs are always the source of truth for visuals, and we should be sure
> to point the reader to these also.

> ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3793636/117873919-f6faba80-b265-11eb-81a5-039bdcd822e8.png)
> Check out [[Content block]] to see how it leverages the anatomy section.

<br />

#### Table options

The table options are predefined templates you can use to detail the
functionality and behavior of a component.

> ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3793636/117873919-f6faba80-b265-11eb-81a5-039bdcd822e8.png)
> The title here is typically `######` an `h6`, and is not included in the table
> of contents generator. That can be changed by updating the `depthEnd`
> attribute if needed.

#### Logic

> The Logic table often handles conditional if/else type statements.

###### Some examples

- Sometimes logic can be good if the component changes from `md` to `lg`
  breakpoint. For example if the `sameHeight` utility gets applied at larger
  breakpoints, but not for smaller breakpoints.
- If a certain value is present in a component, it might do something in
  particular, and if that value is missing it might do something else.

Logic is probably the most used table, and can be a good umbrella table to use
if the other tables aren't useful, because it can be very flexible. Many of the
other table options and given scenarios might also be capable of documenting a
given scenario in a logic table. When you do this, you lose a little context.
Try to use the others first, and use this to fall back on.

It might not be necessary to document the reversed condition if it can be
inferred. For example, if you have a line item in the logic table that says,
"Show this element if true", you probably don't need an additional line item
that says, "Hide element if false". A scenario like this can often be inferred
that it was `undefined`, or `false` and hidden before we showed it upon becoming
`true`.

<details>
  <summary><strong>Example</strong></summary><br />

> _An example of a [[Tabs extended]] component_

###### Logic

|         | condition           | description                        |
| :------ | :------------------ | :--------------------------------- |
| `1.0.1` | `@sm` `@md`         | Switches to [[Accordion]] layout   |
| `1.0.2` | `@lg` `@xlg` `@max` | Switches to [[Carbon tabs]] layout |

<br />
</details><br /><br />

#### Events

> An Event is something the a component might do, or something a user does to a
> component that triggers a single or series of behaviors and functionality.

###### Some examples

- Most of the time you'll be dealing with most of the common events built into
  the browser like `onClick`, `onMouseOver`, and so on.
- Other times the event could relate to something the component does internally
  (for example, data `loads` or `updates`, component `scrolls into view`).
- You may need to call out a custom event that isn't standard. For example, if
  you want to trigger a specific action on the page every time the search
  component in the masthead `opens`/`closes`.

> ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3793636/117873919-f6faba80-b265-11eb-81a5-039bdcd822e8.png) >
> [See a list of DOM events.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events)

While the functional specs track events, we want to avoid redundancy and
duplication. Events inherited from components we depend on don't need to be
called out, and similar events built into the DOM don't always need to be called
out unless we are overriding and customizing the actions taking place. For
instance, a normal link on a page will navigate to the URL given. We don't need
to call this out with an `onClick` because it's common knowledge based on how
the browser works.

<details>
  <summary><strong>Example</strong></summary><br />

> _An example of a scrolling animation_

###### Events

|         | name                  | description        |
| :------ | :-------------------- | :----------------- |
| `1.0.1` | `scrolls-into-view`   | Animates into view |
| `1.0.2` | `scrolls-out-of-view` | Resets animation   |

---

<br />
</details><br /><br />

#### State

> States indicate a given change in behavior and/or visual based on a
> component's current status.

###### Some examples

- The state of a component can change based on whether the user is viewing in
  `dark-mode`, or `light-mode`.
- A card that describes an event can have a few different states depending on
  whether it's in the `past`, `present`, `future`, or altogether `canceled`.
- The state of a component can change based on a user-triggered event to
  indicate an item is either set to `active`, or `selected`.

Depending on the scenario, state can impact the functionality and/or visual
treatment of a given component.

Let's look at an `active` state as an example. When a component is not `active`,
it might visually communicate that it does something on click. If the state of
that component changes to indicate it is now `active` the click event could do
something different, or it might be removed altogether.

In a scenario like this it can be important to call out the different states and
their actions. If the visuals change between states we can call them out without
getting into specifics. Then you can point the reader to review the design specs
where they'll be able to see those types of details.

<details>
  <summary><strong>Example</strong></summary><br />

> _An example of an event card_

###### States

|         | name      | description                                      |
| :------ | :-------- | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `1.0.1` | `past`    | Don't render component                           |
| `1.0.2` | `present` | Enable component's [[CTA]], and adjusts visuals  |
| `1.0.2` | `future`  | Disable component's [[CTA]], and adjusts visuals |

> ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3793636/117873919-f6faba80-b265-11eb-81a5-039bdcd822e8.png)
> See visual design specs <sup>[[r1](#resources)]</sup>

<br />
</details><br /><br />

#### Modifiers

<!-- options, data, modifiers, props -->

> A modifier is something the adopter can set on/in a given component, impacting
> it either visually or functionally.

###### Some examples

- A data list summarizing how a component, or an aspect of that component,
  leverages the common data model and influences its functionality.
- A Kaltura VideoId could be passed into a video component to render the Kaltura
  player with the correct video.
- Showing the options not allowed. For example, CTA types, or styles that are
  limited in decorators.

While nearly every component has at least one option, it isn't always necessary
to list them out in this options section. This section isn't meant to be
exhaustive, so development has the opportunity to build the component the way
they need to. Sometimes however, we do need to lock an option in, to make sure
development includes that option as written.

Dependencies may have their own options, and with those we can either open it up
to all options, scope it down to a limited set, or lock it into a specific
option. This section can be helpful to document how we are deviating from the
original dependency. If the option isn't listed then it's a given that there is
no change to that option, and if one value is provided then we are locking to
that specific value. To indicate a scoped list of values, you can either list
out the options still available, or present in the reverse as "everything but
this one value".

Depending on the needs you could use the `h6` `######` heading to indicate an
option, and then each table row has the options, or you can set the `h6`
`######` to "Options", and each table row gets an option. Use the first if you
need to get detailed and be a little more exhaustive, and the second if you just
need to quickly indicate its scope for a dependency.

| :------ | :---------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `1.0.1` | `short (default)` | Changes height to smallest short, and hides both `CTA` and `copy`. |
| `1.0.2` | `medium`          | Changes `size` to `medium`, adds `CTA` option, but hides `copy`.   |
| `1.0.3` | `tall`            | Changes `size to `tall`, and adds `CTA`and`copy` option.           |

#### Examples

> Examples help support and illustrate a specific aspect of how a component
> looks or functions.

###### Some examples

- An abstract animation to communicate how children are added to a Content block
  component.
- An example of how configuration might visually differ from the main image
  presented in the Anatomy section. For example, horizontal orientation of a
  navigation versus vertical.
- Snippet of code for the developer to reference and understand in detail what's
  expected.

One consideration with this section is how easily it may become outdated
visually. Because of this it's good to focus more on the functionality, and
abstract as much as possible. Sometimes an outdated visual can still effectively
communicate the functionality, but it's the design specs that are intended to
include the most up-to-date visuals, and so a good strategy is to point the
reader there for more information.

This section does not need to be limited to images as examples. When used
correctly it can really help development understand the functionality we are
trying to communicate. Just remember to prioritize the communication of it.

Back to top is a link that helps the reader get to the top of the page quickly.
Usually each [Level 1](#level-1) section should have this, and sometimes the
deeper levels if the content becomes too long. If we do our job right though,
this should rarely happen.
