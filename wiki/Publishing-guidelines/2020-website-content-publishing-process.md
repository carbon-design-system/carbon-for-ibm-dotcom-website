### Resources
- Idea and retro Mural board for publishing is [here](https://app.mural.co/t/digitaldesignsystemsquadwork2176/m/digitaldesignsystemsquadwork2176/1596216481914/86a1304ba4b3b616e89738e5813215f8cd021dbe)
- The Box folder for working items is [here](https://ibm.box.com/s/3mysyf8bdkdo8u2h5baqhphzgnfjlt65)

### Timeline
* Estimated # of sprints: 2 per website page
* Most of the heavy lifting will be in collating, writing, and asset production.
* Reviews will depend on availability of designers and stakeholders.
* The "Sprint order" is not a delivery commitment but rather a best practice.  The timeline is subject to change based on the complexity of the task.
