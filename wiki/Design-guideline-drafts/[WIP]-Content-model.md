<!-- toc start --><!-- toc end -->

### Content field types

- Component
- Long copy (I believe this would be Medium character size and up)
- Short copy (This should be Short character size and below)
- Option list (think of selecting items from a dropdown)
- URL
- Media (This includes images/videos/etc)
- True/False (Normally I would call this boolean, but thatâ€™s not as well known)
