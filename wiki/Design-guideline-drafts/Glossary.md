These are some of the commonly used terms in design and development.

## IBM Design Language, commonly IDL
The core philosophies, guiding principles, and the foundation for IBM Design. Comprises the ethos layer and the element layer. For more information, visit [IBM Design Language site](https://www.ibm.com/design/language).

## Carbon Design System, commonly Carbon
Carbon is IBMâ€™s open-source design system for products and experiences. With the IBM Design Language as its foundation, the system consists of working code, design tools and resources, human interface guidelines, and a vibrant community of contributors. For more information, visit [Carbon Design System site](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/)

## IBM.com Library
This is a collection of components, guidelines, and tools specifically designed and built on for IBM.com. For details, visit [IBM.com Library site](https://ibm-dotcom-library.mybluemix.net/)

## Expressive Theme
This is a flavor of Carbon Design System, optimized for web experiences focusing on reading and learning experiences, as opposed to the product experiences that the original Carbon Design System is optimized for. The main differences include larger type scales, larger components, and larger icons.

## Digital Design System squad
This is the team that is responsible for the design, development, distribution, and adoption of the IBM.com Library.

## Elements
Items that form the structural and stylistic foundation of IBM's design, as an expression of the IBM Design ethos. The elements are used for all media and channels including digital, print, and broadcasting. Elements are listed on the [IBM Design Language site](https://www.ibm.com/design/language/)

##### Examples of elements
Typography, color, grid system, branding, iconography, illustration, photography, motion, etc.

##### Examples of what are not elements
Button, lead space, templates, banner

## Components (also UI components)
Components are key building blocks of the design system, designed and coded to solve a specific user interaction problem in digital environments. Components do not address common user flows and scenarios which are complex and universal. There are other groups of components. such as layout components and functional components. Refer to the later sections on this page.

##### Examples of components
Button, accordion, bread crumbs, input field

##### Examples of what are not components
Page templates, color palette

## Carbon components (also core components)
Components that are part of the Carbon Design System, which serves all digital experiences including products and web. These components are listed on the [Carbon Design System site](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/overview)

## IBM.com components
Components that are built and maintained by the Digital Design System team. These components are built on Carbon and are used on IBM.com. Includes IBM.com specific components including masthead, footer, and locale selector.

## Layout components (formerly layout patterns)
Layout components are more complex building blocks of pages. These incorporate the concept of layout and address well defined user intents or goals.

## Functional compoments
Functional components are non-UI components that usually perform actions behind the scenes.

## Patterns
Patterns are best practice solutions for how a user achieves a goal. They show reusable combinations of components and templates that address common user objectives with sequences and flows. There are different types of patterns such as work-flow patterns, UI patterns, layout patterns. For an overview, visit [Carbon Design System patterns overview page](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/overview).
