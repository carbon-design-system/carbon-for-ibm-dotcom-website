## Various paths for the adoption of Carbon across IBM.com

### For pages produced and published in the Marketing Platforms Drupal CMS, there is the Web Simplification path:
Carbon will be made available through the creation of web simplification templates. The use of these templates as they become available is the path to Carbon because these templates are part of a new content model and publishing tool and have been studied and researched for their overall effectiveness. For more information, please visit [IBM.com Reboot website](https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/ibm-com-reboot).  

In the interim, while these templates are being designed and built-in CMS, page owners can use the Design Guidelines to configure existing pages to have the look and feel of IBM Design Language. For more information, please visit [Marketing Platforms Drupal CMS website](https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/squad-pulse/marketing-platforms/drupal-cms#Links).

### For websites or applications built using v18 (Northstar), v19a, or earlier, there is the IBM.com Library path:**
This website explains how to get started with the IBM.com Library. It provides links to the code repository, the storybook, usage guidelines, and additional resources for getting started. Keep in mind the following things as you get started:

* Carbon and the IBM.com Library is built using Node Package Manager (NPM), not the Content Delivery Network (CDN), so it requires a complete development rewrite, unlike prior design systems.
* Carbon has a new 2x grid so everything needs to be designed understanding that grid.
* It is open source, so any adopters are invited to contribute to the open source IBM.com Library.

To assist adopters through this transition, Digital Design squad can consult with a team as they are getting started or as they are ready for review. Reach out on our slack channel at [#ibm-digital-design](https://ibm-studios.slack.com/archives/C2PLX8GQ6).
