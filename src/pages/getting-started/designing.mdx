Rapidly build beautiful and accessible experiences. The Carbon for IBM.com kit contains all the resources you need to get started.

</PageDescription>

## Get the kit

**1. Install Sketch.**
To design with the Digital Design System you must have the most recent version of [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com) installed.

**2. Set up Box Drive.**
If you currently use Box Sync, you must uninstall it to use Box Drive. You can follow the steps on [Uninstalling Box Sync Manually](#) document to uninstall Box Sync and [Installing and Updating Box Drive](#) document to install the Box Drive.

The Digital Design System team releases frequent updates to the design kit. Follow the instructions above to stay up to date with the latest changes via Box Drive.

**3. Request access.**
Please slack @oliviaFlory to be added to the design kit folder.

**4. Set up Sketch library and theme.**
You can save the template and library by navigating to the `Digital Design kit → X folder`. 

To save the grid template, open the “IBM Design template” file in Sketch, from the menu choose `File → save as template → save`.

To add the library, from Sketch navigate to `Preferences → Libraries → Add Library`and select `Box → IBM Design kit → Digital Design → X folder → Expressive theme`.

There are four Digital Design themes, two light (White and Gray 10) and two dark (Gray 90 and Gray 100). Each theme lives in its Sketch library. You can subscribe to as many libraries as you’d like.

Be sure to add the library following the instructions above. The Digital Design System team does not recommend downloading the “IBM Digital Design” Sketch file to your local drive because you will not receive the updates as they are published.

For product design, the [Carbon](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/) kit is available via Sketch Cloud and you do not have to request access to the box folder.

**5. Bring in additional colors and icons.**
The full icon library and additional color collections live in the IBM Design Language library.

## Start designing

To get started with the Digital Design System, familiarize yourself with the contents of each library and template.

**Start with the grid.**
At the top of your screen, navigate to `File → New file from Template`and select the “IBM Design template” file in Sketch. You’ll always be able to find the template there.

**Icons and color swatches.**
The full icon library and full IBM color pallete live in the [IBM Design Language library](sketch://add-library/cloud/nwqmk).

**You’re all set.**
Refer to the content below for a more detailed breakdown of the kit, or head to Sketch to begin designing.

## Anatomy

### Grid

The IBM 2x Grid is the framework for laying out all visual elements. You can find the grid template inside of the “IBM Design template” file in Sketch. See the [Grid](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/2x-grid/implementation) guideline for a more detailed walkthrough of the 2x Grid.

![Image of sketch showing the grid](../../images/get-started/Designing_Grid_Sketch.jpg)

**Structure**
The grid template includes templates for all breakpoints along with the necessary formulas to design for custom screen sizes.

To toggle the grid on and off, use `Control+G`. To toggle the layout guide, use `Control+L`.

### Symbols

Digital Design System components, and colors live in the design kit as Sketch symbols.

![Image of sketch showing symbols](../../images/get-started/Designing_Symbols_Sketch.jpg)

**Library menu navigation**
There are two kinds of symbols — library symbols and document symbols. Library symbols are available in any Sketch document, while document symbols are specific to the document in which they are found.

From the Insert menu, select `Symbols → IBM Digital Design`to add symbols onto your page.

Digital Design System symbols are built to be flexible, and designers should not detach symbols from the library. Once a symbol is detached, you will no longer receive updates as they are released.

**Structure**
Symbols are organized by Components; after selecting a component, you’ll see the variations and states of that component.

– To add the whole component, select the desired variant and place it on your artboard.

### Text styles

Text styles are based on the typography rules that are defined by the [IBM Design Language](https://www.ibm.com/design/language/).

![Image of sketch showing text styles](../../images/get-started/Designing_TextStyles_Sketch.jpg)

**Library menu navigation**
From the main menu select `Insert → Text Styles → IBM Digital Design` to insert a Digital Design System text style.

Text styles within components are carefully considered. We do not recommend detaching the symbol to change default styles.

**Structure**
Digital Design System text styles in Sketch are organized similarly to symbols.

– The first text style level displays breakpoints (i.e., lg (1056 breakpoint) or fixed size).
– The second level shows the text color options (i.e., Gray 80).
– The third level selects the type style, which is labeled with the Digital Design System type style name.

### Layer styles

Layer styles are color selections for any shape in Sketch.

![Image of sketch showing layer styles](../../images/get-started/Designing_LayersStyles_Sketch.jpg)

Use predetermined overrides when possible.

**Library menu navigation**
Color in the Digital Design System is carefully considered, and we discourage custom layer styles.

The first layer is the Digital Design System colors (i.e., gray-100).

## Info

If you’re brand new to Sketch, they offer some great [tutorials and help docs](https://www.sketch.com/docs/).

### Updates

We make small adjustments and bug fixes to the kit on a regular basis. When we make a change to any of the libraries, you will be notified via a red pop-up in the top right corner of the Sketch window.

The updates are opt-in, however we recommend you keep your kit as up to date as possible. Once a change is accepted, you will not be able to revert to the previous version.

### Support

If you experience any issues while getting set up with IBM Digital Design kit, please head over to the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-for-ibm-website/issues/new/choose) for more guidelines and support. Please [create an issue](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-for-ibm-website/issues/new/choose) if your issue does not already exist.

You can also have your questions answered on the [#digital-design-adopters-designers](https://cognitive-app.slack.com/archives/GNKN3G37F) Slack channel.
