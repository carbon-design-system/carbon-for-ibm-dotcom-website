## IBM.com Library

This library provides front-end developers and engineers a collection of reusable components to build websites and user interfaces quickly and efficiently. Adopting the library enables developers to use consistent markup, styles, and behavior in prototype and production work. 

## Install

Run the following command using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com):

```npm i @carbon/ibmdotcom-react carbon-components-react carbon-components carbon-icons
```

If you prefer [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/), use the following command instead:

```yarn add @carbon/ibmdotcom-react carbon-components-react carbon-components carbon-icons
```

## Getting Started

1. 	These components require the use of [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org) in your project. See our [webpack.config.js](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/ibm-dotcom-library/blob/master/packages/react/.storybook/webpack.config.js) for an example configuration.

2. 	Components do not import any of the styles themselves, use the scss or css from @carbon/ibmdotcom-styles to bring in styling.

3. 	For older browsers (e.g. IE11), polyfills listed in [packages/react/.storybook/polyfills.js](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/ibm-dotcom-library/blob/master/packages/react/.storybook/polyfills.js) file is required.

## Usage

You can view available React Components in [Storybook](https://ibmdotcom-react.netlify.com/?path=/story/dotcom-shell--default) and see usage information in several ways below:

1. 	Clicking the **“Story”** tab at the bottom. This tab contains the code that shows how the component is being used

2. 	Clicking the **“Knobs”** tab at the bottom and changing values there. Most knobs are shown as something like `Button kind (kind)`, where `kind`is the name of React prop.

3. 	Clicking the **“Readme”** tab at the bottom. You can see some more 	document for some components.

## IBM.com Shell

If you are looking to get started on a page, you can make use of the **`<DotcomShell>`**, which is a React based UI Shell that contains the `<Masthead>` and the `<Footer>`, using Carbon's grid. View React Components in [Storybook](https://ibmdotcom-react.netlify.com/?path=/story/dotcom-shell--default).
