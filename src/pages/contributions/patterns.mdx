## First steps to contributing


If you’ve designed a pattern that is not currently in Carbon, contributing it
back allows others in the community to refine and use your pattern in their
projects.


To contribute a component to Carbon for IBM.com, Start by opening a <a href="https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-for-ibm-dotcom/issues/new/choose" target="_blank">Github issue</a> and select Feature Request.

Include a detailed description in which you:


- Define your pattern and explain the rationale
- Include mockups and/or prototypes of any fidelity
- Clarify whether it uses existing components, new components, or both
- Include competitive and comparative analysis, and any inspirations from other
  products


This issue will be the staging ground for the pattern contribution, and you
should expect the Carbon for IBM.com team and the community to weigh in with
suggestions.


We encourage you to surface work in progress. If you’re not able to complete all
of the parts yourself, someone in the community may be able to help.


## How to write a pattern

We are in the work process to create guidelines to help you prepare a complete and comprehensive pattern. The guidelines and the required structure will be coming soon.
