## First steps to contributing


To contribute a component to Carbon for IBM.com, Start by opening a <a href="https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-for-ibm-dotcom/issues/new/choose" target="_blank">Github issue</a> and select Feature Request.

Include a detailed description in which you:
- Explain the rationale
- Detail the intended behavior
- Clarify whether it's a variation of an existing component, or a new asset
- Include mockups of any fidelity (optional)
- Include any inspirations from other products (optional)


## Documentation requirements

Our component usage documentation typically contains the definition of the component, a visual reference of what the component and its variations look like (if any), design, and function specifications.


## Parts of a component contribution

Component contributions ideally include all of the following parts.

#### 1. A rationale

Explain how your component will add value to the system. Carbon for IBM.com serves the
widest possible range of IBM.com needs, and contributions that increase the scope of
the system are more likely to be accepted. Be sure to include any user
experience and interaction descriptions.

#### 2. A design spec

Create sizing and styling annotations for all aspects of the component. This
spec should provide a developer with everything they need to create the design
in code. Check out Carbon's <a href="https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/wiki/Production-guidelines#spec-guidelines" target="_blank">production guidelines</a>
to get started.

You should include color tokens and type tokens used.

#### 3. A Sketch symbol

Any new components or changes to existing components will also live in the
[Carbon for IBM.com kit](https://www.ibm.com/standards/web/carbon-for-ibm-dotcom/get-started/designing#get-the-kit) and so we'll need a Sketch symbol.
Check out <a href="https://www.sketch.com/docs/symbols/creating-symbols/" target="_blank">Sketch's guide</a> for creating a symbol.

This symbol can be contributed with the asset or enhancement, but must be added
to the kit by one of its maintainers. To contribute a symbol, simply open an
issue in the
[kit repo](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-for-ibm-dotcom-design-kit/issues/new?assignees=oliviaflory&template=bug-report.md&title=%5BDesign+kit%5D%3A+Brief+description).

#### 4. Usage documentation

For guidance, see our Documentation requirements section above or reach out to us on <a href="https://ibm-studios.slack.com/archives/C2PLX8GQ6" target="_blank">#ibm-digital-design</a>.

#### 5. Working code

The component or enhancement must be built in one of our supported frameworks
(React and Web Components). See the [Developer guide](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-for-ibm-dotcom/blob/master/docs/developing.md) for detail.
