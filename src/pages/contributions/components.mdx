<PageDescription>


Component contributions can take different forms. Some are enhancements to existing components
or a brand new component. It can even be a layout component which brings several components together to form a commonly used element, like a call to action button on a Lead Space.

## First steps to contributing


To contribute a component to Carbon for IBM.com, start by opening a <a href="https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-for-ibm-dotcom/issues/new/choose" target="_blank">Github issue</a> and select Feature Request.

Include a detailed description in which you:
- Explain the rationale for the request
- Detail the intent and/or usage
- Clarify whether it's a variation of an existing component, or a new component
- Include mockups of any fidelity (optional)
- Include any inspirations from other products (optional)


## Documentation requirements

Component documentation typically contains a definition of the component, a visual reference of what the component will look like along with its variations (if any).  The documentation must include designs and functional specifications.  Remember you are contributing this component so others benefit from the effort already made by you or your team.  It's sub-optimal if it still requires other teams to do rework.  


## Component contribution

Component contributions ideally include all of the following parts.

#### 1. A rationale

Explain how your component will add value to the system. Carbon for IBM.com serves the
widest possible range of IBM.com needs, and contributions that increase the scope of
the system are more likely to be accepted. Be sure to include any user
experience and interaction descriptions.

#### 2. A design spec

Create sizing and styling annotations for all aspects of the component. This
spec should provide a developer with everything they need to create the design
in code. Check out Carbon's <a href="https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/wiki/Production-guidelines#spec-guidelines" target="_blank">production guidelines</a> to get started.

You should include color tokens and type tokens used.

#### 3. A Sketch symbol

Any new components or changes to existing components will also live in the
[Carbon for IBM.com kit](https://www.ibm.com/standards/web/carbon-for-ibm-dotcom/get-started/designing#get-the-kit) and so we'll need a Sketch symbol.
Check out <a href="https://www.sketch.com/docs/symbols/creating-symbols/" target="_blank">Sketch's guide</a> for creating a symbol.

This symbol can be contributed with the asset or enhancement, but must be added
to the kit by one of its maintainers. To contribute a symbol, simply open an
issue in the
[kit repo](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-for-ibm-dotcom-design-kit/issues/new?assignees=oliviaflory&template=bug-report.md&title=%5BDesign+kit%5D%3A+Brief+description).

#### 4. Usage documentation

For guidance, see our Documentation requirements section above or reach out to us on <a href="https://ibm-studios.slack.com/archives/C2PLX8GQ6" target="_blank">#carbon-for-ibm-dotcom</a>.

#### 5. Working code

The component for **Carbon for IBM.com** must be built in one of our supported frameworks - React or Web Components.  We'd like to prioritize working on Web Components since it has become our strategic direction.  If you need help learning how to build it in Web Components, reach out to the engineers in our slack channel for training <a href="https://ibm-studios.slack.com/archives/C2PLX8GQ6" target="_blank">#carbon-for-ibm-dotcom</a>.  Please read the [Developer guide](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-for-ibm-dotcom/blob/master/docs/developing.md) and the [Submissions guidelines](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-for-ibm-dotcom/blob/master/docs/submission-guidelines.md) for more details.
