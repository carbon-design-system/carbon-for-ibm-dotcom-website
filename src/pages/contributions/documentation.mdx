## Editing pages

The easiest way to edit a page is with the `Edit this page on GitHub` link that
appears at the bottom of every page on the site. The link opens the specific
GitHub page where you can edit the content and then propose the change with a
pull request.

Alternatively, if you have a specific fix or contribution, you can fork the repo
and generate a pull request.

## Content and style guidelines

Before you get started, take a moment to review our content guidelines.
Following these will help us ensure consistency of experience across the site.

### Use Markdown

The website is written in <a href="https://gatsby-theme-carbon.now.sh/components/markdown/" target="_blank">Markdown</a>, which makes
it easy for anyone to contribute content in a systematic way. If you don't
already have a Markdown editor installed, there are plenty of free editors
available online.

Check out the handy markdown [styling cheatsheet](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-for-ibm-dotcom-website/wiki/Markdown-cheatsheet) for how to style content.

### Guidelines for writing content

Please keep these things in mind when writing content for Carbon.

- Aim for a friendly and encouraging tone.
- Speak directly to the user. You can use the second person pronoun ("you").
- Use “the user” when it doesn’t have to be multiple, and “users” when the notion of multiple users is needed.
- Keep sentences and paragraphs short and focused.
- Be clear and concise by removing unnecessary words. The more concise the text,
  the easier it is for all users to understand.
- Use sentence case for everything, including component names, e.g. Content
  switcher and Data table.
