<PageDescription>

IBM.com is a place for people to learn about, try, and buy IBM products and services. Visitors to IBM.com deserve to have an efficient and delightful experience while on their journey.

</PageDescription>

<PageDescription>

Towards that end, IBM.com Library has been built with the goal of providing efficiency and consistency across IBM.com using IBM Design Language (IDL) principles and based on the Carbon Design System (Carbon). IBM.com Library is focused on supporting IBM.com applications and/or website owners who want to adopt IDL and Carbon and need specific features relevant to IBM.com.

## What is included in IBM.com Library?
IBM.com Library includes the following:

* Components usage and code (e.g. Masthead and Footer)
* Layout patterns usage and code (e.g. Lead Space and Table of Contents)
* Services and utilities (e.g. required Tealium)
* Implementation guidelines 
* Sketch design kit 
* Examples and resources
* Metrics
* Accessibility tested and compliant
* Optimized code

## How to decide the right path for adoption

### For pages produced and published in Marketing Platforms Drupal CMS, follow IBM.com Reboot:
Carbon will be made available through the creation of Drupal v2 templates. The use of these templates as they become available is the path to Carbon because these templates are part of a new content model and publishing tool and have been studied and researched for their overall effectiveness. 

For more information, please visit [IBM.com Reboot website](https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/ibm-com-reboot).

In the interim, while these templates are being built, page owners can use the Design Guidelines to configure existing pages to have the look and feel of IBM Design Language. 

For more information, please visit [Marketing Platforms Drupal CMS website](https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/squad-pulse/marketing-platforms/drupal-cms#Links).

### For websites or applications on v18 (Northstar), v19a, or earlier, make plans now to migrate your site to IBM.com Library
This site explains how to get started with IBM.com Library. It provides links to the code repository, the storybook, usage guidelines, and additional resources for getting started. Keep in mind the following things as you get started:

* Carbon and the IBM.com Library is built using Node Package Manager (NPM), not the Content Delivery Network (CDN), so it requires a complete development rewrite, unlike prior design systems.
* Carbon has a new 2x grid so everything needs to be designed understanding that grid.
* It is open source, so any adopters are invited to contribute to the open source IBM.com Library.

To assist adopters through this transition, Digital Design can guide a team as they are getting started or if they want a code review. Reach out on our slack channel at [#ibm-digital-design](https://ibm-studios.slack.com/archives/C2PLX8GQ6).

## Design adopter kit

We have created an design adopters kit to provide you with upcoming guidelines, important IBM Design sites, and IBM.com sketch assets. At the moment, this kit is a work in progress. Please request access here and we will continue to add to it as we produce more guidelines and resources.
