## Introduction
The Carbon for IBM.com team is working to adopt the Carbon design system for IBM.com. Please check the [adoption paths](http://ibm-dotcom-library.mybluemix.net/get-started#how-to-decide-the-right-path-for-adoption) and discuss with your team before adopting Carbon for IBM.com.  

The Carbon for IBM.com kit includes expressive type styles for editorial experiences and IBM.com specific components including the IBM.com masthead and footer. Teams should utilize the Carbon design kits for core components such as buttons, form components, etc. If you have any questions please reach out on our [slack channel](https://cognitive-app.slack.com/archives/C2PLX8GQ6).

## Get the kit

**1. Install Sketch.**
To design with the Carbon for IBM.com kit you must have the most recent version of [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com) installed.

**2. Set up Box Drive.**
If you currently use Box Sync, you must uninstall it to use Box Drive. You can follow the steps on [Uninstalling Box Sync](https://community.box.com/t5/Using-Box-Sync/Uninstalling-Box-Sync-Manually/ta-p/51105?advanced=false&collapse_discussion=true&filter=location&location=category:English&q=unintall%20box%20sync&search_type=thread) Manually document to uninstall Box Sync and [Installing and Updating Box Drive](https://community.box.com/t5/Getting-Started-with-Box-Drive/Installing-and-Updating-Box-Drive/ta-p/37450) document to install the Box Drive.

The Carbon for IBM.com team releases frequent updates to the design kit. Follow the instructions above to stay up to date with the latest changes via Box Drive.

**3. Set up Sketch library and templates.** 

You can save the template and library by navigating to the `Carbon for IBM.com design kit` folder.

To save the grid template, open the “IBM Design template” file in Sketch, from the menu choose `File → save as template → save`.

Follow the same instructions for the "IBM.com Shell template".

To add the libraries, from Sketch navigate to `Preferences → Libraries → Add Library` and select `Box →  Carbon for IBM.com design kit → Carbon for IBM.com (White theme)`.
Follow the same instructions for the other theme libraries.

  </Column>
</Row>

Be sure to add the libraries following the instructions above. The Carbon for IBM.com team does not recommend downloading the Sketch files to your local drive because you will not receive the updates as they are published.

For core components and product design, the [Carbon kit](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/get-started/design/#get-the-kit) is available via Sketch Cloud and you do not have to request access to the box folder.

**4. Bring in additional colors and icons.**
The full IBM color pallet lives in the [IBM Design Language library](sketch://add-library/cloud/nwqmk). The IBM icons live in the [IBM Icons (16px, 20px) library](sketch://add-library/cloud/KW2yr) and [IBM Icons (24, 32px) library](sketch://add-library/cloud/2bwkM).

## Start designing
To get started with the Carbon for IBM.com kits, familiarize yourself with the contents of each library and template.

**Start with the grid.** At the top of your screen, navigate to `File → New file from Template` and select the “IBM Design template” or "IBM.com Shell template" file in Sketch. You’ll always be able to find the template there.

**Icons and color swatches.** The full IBM color pallet lives in the [IBM Design Language library](sketch://add-library/cloud/nwqmk). The IBM icons live in the [IBM Icons (16px, 20px) library](sketch://add-library/cloud/KW2yr) and [IBM Icons (24, 32px) library](sketch://add-library/cloud/2bwkM), you can install both icon libraries or just the one that suits your experience needs.

**You’re all set.** Refer to the content below for a more detailed breakdown of the kit, or head to Sketch to begin designing.

## Anatomy

### Grid

The IBM 2x Grid is the framework for laying out all visual elements. You can find the grid template inside of the “IBM Design template” file in Sketch. See the [Grid guideline](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/2x-grid/implementation) for a more detailed walkthrough of the 2x Grid.

![Image of sketch showing the grid](../../images/get-started/Designing_Grid_Sketch.jpg)

#### Structure 
The grid template includes templates for all breakpoints along with the necessary formulas to design for custom screen sizes.

To toggle the grid on and off, use `Control+G`. To toggle the layout guide, use `Control+L`.

### Symbols

IBM.com Library components live in the design kit as Sketch symbols.

![Image of sketch showing symbols](../../images/get-started/Designing_Symbols_Sketch.jpg)

#### Library menu navigation 
There are two kinds of symbols — library symbols and document symbols. Library symbols are available in any Sketch document, while document symbols are specific to the document in which they are found.

From the Insert menu, select `Symbols → IBM.com Library` to add symbols onto your page.

IBM.com Library symbols are built to be flexible, and designers should not detach symbols from the library. Once a symbol is detached, you will no longer receive updates as they are released.

#### Structure 
Symbols are organized by Components; after selecting a component, you’ll see the variations and states of that component.

* To add the whole component, select the desired variant and place it on your artboard.

### Text styles
Text styles are based on the typography rules that are defined by the [IBM Design Language](https://www.ibm.com/design/language/).

![Image of sketch showing text styles](../../images/get-started/Designing_TextStyles_Sketch.jpg)

#### Library menu navigation 
From the main menu select `Insert → Text Styles → IBM.com` to insert a IBM.com Library text style.

Text styles within components are carefully considered. We do not recommend detaching the symbol to change default styles.

#### Structure 

IBM.com Library text styles in Sketch are organized similarly to symbols.

#### Fixed sizes
* The first text style level shows the IBM.com Library type token (i.e. body-long-01).
* The second level selects the type color, which is labeled with a IBM.com Library color token name (i.e. text-01).

#### Expressive sizes

* The first text style level displays the expressive type styles.
* The second level shows the breakpoints (i.e. lg (1056)).
* The third level shows the IBM.com Library type token (i.e. body-long-01).
* The fourth level selects the type color, which is labeled with a IBM.com Library color token name (i.e. text-01).


### Layer styles
Layer styles are color selections for any shape in Sketch.

![Image of sketch showing layer styles](../../images/get-started/Designing_LayersStyles_Sketch.jpg)

Use predetermined overrides when possible. 

#### Library menu navigation 

Color in the IBM Design System is carefully considered, and we discourage custom layer styles.

* The first layer is the theme selection (i.e. IBM.com Library (White theme)). 
* The second layer is core IBM.com Library color tokens (i.e., field-01) for the selected them.
* The interaction state tokens are nested in a third layer under “state”.

## Info
If you’re brand new to Sketch, they offer some great [tutorials and help docs](https://www.sketch.com/docs/).

### Updates
We make small adjustments and bug fixes to the kit on a regular basis. When we make a change to any of the libraries, you will be notified via a red pop-up in the top right corner of the Sketch window.

The updates are opt-in, however we recommend you keep your kit as up to date as possible. Once a change is accepted, you will not be able to revert to the previous version.

### Support
If you experience any issues while getting set up with IBM.com Library, please head over to the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/ibm-dotcom-library-design-kit) and please [create an issue](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/ibm-dotcom-library-design-kit/issues/new?assignees=oliviaflory&template=bug-report.md&title=%5BDesign+kit%5D%3A+Brief+description) if your issue does not already exist.
