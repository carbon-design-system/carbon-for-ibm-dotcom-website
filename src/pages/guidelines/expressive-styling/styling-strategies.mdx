Carbon Design System provides two type sets that support both productive and expressive
moments. Primarily, productive was designed for product and expressive was
designed for web pages, but there are opportunities to blend contrasting moments
to provide clarity through hierarchy, and elevate the overall experience.

## Overview

In Carbon Design System, there are two type sets available for use with productive and
expressive experiences. The productive type styles were developed for product
design, and the expressive, fluid type styles were developed for
IBM.com website pages.

The overarching rule has been to use the productive type styles for product
design and the expressive for editorial pages. For the most part, this is still a good
guideline to follow. However, there are situations where we can create
contrasting moments that better support the user's intention or task.

Let's look at the respective design rationales for each experience, and then see
where it makes sense to provide a blend.

## Expressive use cases

Carbon for IBM.com is for the creators of IBM.com and it provides components, along with typography guidelines, that support expressive use cases.

#### When to use expressive type styles

The key drivers for the use of expressive type styles are:

- Users are trying to learn and explore, and are primarily scanning and reading.
- Interactions are more passive through impactful imagery, layout, and long form
  reading.
- Users typically traverse a series of pages during one session.
- Key performance indicators consider success in terms of click-through rates
  and final purchases.

Given these considerations, larger type sizes and a more editorial approach
allows users to scan, read, and navigate multiple pages with comfort and ease.

#### Styles for expressive moments

To create expressive moments, use the body styles and utility styles with the
`02` suffix. There are also two fixed headings, as well as fluid headings that
will adjust with different breakpoints.

For the fixed headings, ensure consistent line heights by using the following
pairings:

- pair `body-02` with `heading-02`
- pair `body-compact-02` with `heading-compact-02`

As well as these two fixed headings, there is a set of fluid headings that add a
series of scales and fluid behavior.

## Productive use cases

Carbon Design System started as the design system for IBM Products and primarily provides
typography that supports productive use cases.

#### When to use productive type styles

The key drivers for the use of productive type styles are:

- Users are focused on getting a specific job done.
- Interactions are more active, through inputs, forms, and controls.
- Users are embedded within the experience, often on one page, for awhile.
- Key performance indicators consider success in terms of time needed to
  complete a task and also the abandonment rate.

Given these considerations, space efficiency is key. Keeping content condensed
is helpful to support focus on complex tasks.

#### Styles for productive moments

To create productive moments, use the body styles and supporting styles with the
`01` suffix, as well as the fixed headings.

To ensure consistent line heights, use the following pairings:

- pair `body-01` with `heading-01`
- pair `body-compact-01` with `heading-compact-01`

All productive headings are fixed.

## Blending type sets

The spaces we are designing for are no longer neatly divided between productive
and expressive. Both product and web pages can be blended with what we call
"moments" if the alternative type set better supports the function.

If your users are working in a product but pausing to read or scan for options,
an expressive moment can facilitate easy reading and/or create a desired impact
or pause. In these cases, however the "moment" would span a full page or banner
where there are no containers.

If your users are reading on the website but then switch to a focused task
within the web experience, using productive styles within that component would
facilitate the focus required for an interactive task such as filling out a form.

### Using productive moments within IBM.com pages

Here are some of the examples where IBM.com uses productive moments:

- The global masthead mega menu
- IBM.com search
- Commerce
- Product configuration
- Account creation
- Filter panel in catalogs

### Using expressive moments within product designs

The productive experience is all about keeping the user focused and able to
complete complex tasks, therefore the areas where expressive moments can be used
are less common. However, when the user is first entering the product, or moving
to another area of the product you may find opportunities.

For expressive moments, you are looking for areas where the page opens up and
the content is not restricted to a container, card, or data table. Home pages
and page headers or banners are two possibilities.

For more details about home pages, IBMers can reference the
[World overview page pattern](https://pages.github.ibm.com/ibmcloud/pal/patterns/world-overview-pages/usage/)
in the IBM Cloud library.

## Tips and techniques

#### Use a blend of the two sets to establish distinctions and create hierarchies

You can use the two type sets to provide contrast and hierarchy within two
areas. For example, a filter panel using productive type becomes less
prominent next to a list of results using expressive type styles. By pushing
the functional elements into the background, items of user interest take the focus.

#### Match and support user tasks

Within each type set, there are appropriately sized type styles for each user
task. Follow the use case definitions for expressive and productive moments to
determine when it's appropriate to use each type set.

_When users need to focus on a task_ and are interacting through inputs, forms,
and controls, use the productive type set.

_When users are learning and exploring,_ and interacting through impactful
imagery, layout, and long form reading, pull from the expressive type set.

#### Keep type styles consistent within a discrete task, component, or region

People unconsciously use type size as a signal of hierarchy, and each type set
has been designed with expectations about hierarchy in mind. Mixing type styles
within a component could jumble the hierarchy and create confusion.
