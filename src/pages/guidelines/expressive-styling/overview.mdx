These pages explain everything you need to know about expressive styling for IBM.com pages, including expressive components, type styles, and type and icon pairing.

**Note:** The Expressive theme has been integrated into Carbon Design System’s core library. This means that expressive continues to be available to IBM.com, but now all Carbon adopters can get both productive and expressive experiences from the same library source. In the next few sprints, we will be shifting to use expressive styling and elements from core, after which the Expressive theme within Carbon for IBM.com will no longer be maintained. <a href="../../help/expressive-update">Learn more about this change</a>.

## Coming soon

The Carbon for IBM.com and Carbon teams have been working to consolidate assets into the one core library. 

- *Three core components (Button, Link, and List)* will be added as expressive variants to the core Carbon library and will available in the Carbon Sketch kit and Carbon repos. 

- *The Carbon Sketch kit* now contains expressive styling. What was previously known as the Expressive Theme has now been integrated into the core library, and the Expressive Theme Sketch kit is no longer being maintained.

- *The usage guidance* for the productive and expressive type sets has been updated to explain and illustrate where blending of the the type sets can enhance experiences.

- *The type token names* have been streamlined for ease of use.

- *The Sketch kit flyout menus* for type styles have been redesigned to accommodate expressive styling and to help with decision making.

- *A Carbon for IBM.com Sketch kit* with IBM web page components is currently in the works. 

## What is expressive styling?

Expressive styling has been carefully designed and curated to serve people using our web pages, and supports the following needs:

- Users are trying to learn and explore, and are primarily scanning and reading. 
- Interactions are more passive through impactful imagery, layout, and long form reading.
- Users typically traverse a series of pages during one session. 
- Key performance indicators consider success in terms of click-through rates and final purchases. 

Given these needs and interaction styles, larger type sizes and a more editorial approach allows users to scan, read, and navigate multiple pages with comfort and ease. The expressive elements work together to support these needs and create clear expectations about hierarchy. 

## Pairing type with icons

</Row>

### Type scale

The Expressive theme increases Carbon Design System’s base type size of 14px to 16px and systematically increased the other type sizes within the system.

<Column colMd={8} colLg={8}>

</Row>


<Title>Type token changes</Title>

The base type size is increasing from 14px to 16px.


| Type token | Carbon default scale (size/line-height) | Carbon Expressive scale (size/line-height) |
|:---|:---|:---|
|`$code-01`|12px / 16px|14px / 20px|
|`$code-02`|14px / 20px|16px / 24px|
|`$caption-01`|12px / 16px|14px / 18px|
|`$label-01`|12px / 16px|14px / 18px|
|`$helper-text-01`|12px / 16px|14px / 18px|
|`$body-short-01`|14px / 18px|16px / 22px|
|`$body-long-01`|14px / 20px|16px / 24px|
|`productive-heading-01`|14px / 18px|16px / 22px|


### Icons

To match the increased type size, the standard 16px by 16px icon size for Carbon's 14px base type has increased to 20px by 20px for the 16px base type in the Expressive theme.

### Containers

Container sizes were increased systematically to accommodate the larger type sizes. The default container size for most components increased from 40px to 48px.

## Expressive theme process

By default, the Expressive Theme is enabled in Carbon for IBM.com (starting in `v1.10.0`). This is to guarantee consistency across
all IBM.com experiences. However, the Expressive Theme is also available as its own offering within the Carbon for IBM.com
styles package (available in `v1.9.0`). Read more about how to implement within any non-IBM.com applications at
<a href="https://carbon-expressive.mybluemix.net" target="_blank">https://carbon-expressive.mybluemix.net</a>.

As mentioned above, this process will be changing soon but we will provide plenty of details to make your transition smooth.
