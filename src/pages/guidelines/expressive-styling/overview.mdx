## Recent updates for expressive

#### Asset consolidation

The Carbon for IBM.com and Carbon teams have been working to consolidate foundational assets, including expressive and productive type sizes, into Carbon Design System’s core library. As the final step in this work, we removed the expressive wrapper in v1.25.0 (27 Sep 2021). [Learn more](../../whats-happening/expressive-update).

#### New design kits

We have been working on new design kits, in both Figma and Sketch. We’re releasing the kits iteratively and the [first versions](http:../../whats-happening/expressive-update#what-does-this-mean-for-designers) are available now. They include color tokens, and expressive and productive type styles. We’ll be adding key components from the Carbon for IBM.com library over time. 

#### Expressive variants in the Carbon core library

The Button, Link, and List core components have been available as expressive variants in the Carbon repo since Carbon v10.35 and will be available in the Carbon Sketch kit from v11 forward. We will also be adding these components to the new Carbon for IBM.com design kits.


## What is expressive styling?

Expressive styling has been carefully designed and curated to serve people visiting IBM.com. It features larger type sizes and a more editorial approach to allows users to scan, read, and navigate multiple pages with comfort and ease. Specifically, expressive styling supports the following needs:

- Users are trying to learn and explore, and are primarily scanning and reading. 
- Interactions are more passive through impactful imagery, layout, and long form reading.
- Users typically traverse a series of pages during one session. 
- Key performance indicators consider success in terms of click-through rates and final purchases. 

Given these needs and interaction behaviors, the expressive styles are optimized to improve content hierarchy, visual engagement, and set clear expectations as user goes from page to page.

We've created detailed usage guidance for working with the productive and expressive type sets, explaining and illustrating where blending of the type sets can enhance experiences. Learn more on the [Styling strategies](../expressive-styling/styling-strategies) tab. 

## Differences between expressive and productive

Expressive styling is used primarily for IBM.com web pages, and productive styling is most used for products. There are some situations where you can blend both stylings, however it's good to understand the basics and the differences between the two stylistic expressions. 

### Type sizes and styles

#### Type sizes

The expressive type styles are primarily used for web pages and the larger sizes allow for a more dramatic, graphic use of type in editorial and marketing design. These type styles are excellent for long form reading and scanning, but
would be distracting for use in product. 

The productive type set is primarily used within product spaces, where users benefit from a more condensed treatment of content to maintain focus on tasks. 

<Row>
<Column colMd={8} colLg={8}>

![Base type size change](../../../images/guidelines/expressive-theme/type-size.png)

<Caption>The productive base type size is 14px and the expressive base type size is 16px.</Caption>

</Column>
</Row>

#### Type styles 

Within **Body styles** and **Supporting styles**, the same set of styles are offered. Expressive style names have a suffix of `-02` and productive styles are named with a suffix of `-01`.

There are two heading sets and the major difference between them is in how they are implemented in code. Expressive headings are responsive, or fluid, and the type styles change size at different breakpoints. The productive type set uses fixed headings. 

#### Type token differences

The following table shows the differences between the productive and expressive type token sizes and line heights.

** New table coming from Shixie, based on this one....

| Type token | Carbon default scale (size/line-height) | Carbon Expressive scale (size/line-height) |
|:---|:---|:---|
|`$code-01`|12px / 16px|14px / 20px|
|`$code-02`|14px / 20px|16px / 24px|
|`$caption-01`|12px / 16px|14px / 18px|
|`$label-01`|12px / 16px|14px / 18px|
|`$helper-text-01`|12px / 16px|14px / 18px|
|`$body-short-01`|14px / 18px|16px / 22px|
|`$body-long-01`|14px / 20px|16px / 24px|
|`productive-heading-01`|14px / 18px|16px / 22px|



### Icon sizes

Icon sizes between expressive and productive are different, as they've been designed to match the type size. 

In expressive situations, use 20px by 20px icons to match the larger type sizes. In productive situations, the icon sizes are generally 16px by 16px with some exceptions for success messages where the icons may be 20px by 20px.

<Row>
<Column colMd={8} colLg={8}>

</Column>
</Row>


#### Icon token differences

** Shixie, what do we want to do with this table?

| Icon token | Productive scale | Expressive scale |
|:---|:---|:---|
|`$icon-01`|16px|20px|
|`$icon-02`|20px|20px|



### Container sizes 

Container sizes are also larger within expressive stylings to accommodate the larger type sizes. The following image shows the increases.

** Shixie, not sure what to say here. I'll wait for updated image. 

<Row>
<Column colMd={8} colLg={8}>

![Container size differences](../../../images/guidelines/expressive-theme/container-size.png)

</Column>
</Row>


### Component sizes

Component sizes also increases to accommodate the larger expressive type styles, as shown below with buttons and the checkbox component. 

<Row>
<Column colMd={8} colLg={8}>

![Component difference examples](../../../images/guidelines/expressive-theme/component-examples.png)

</Column>
</Row>

#### Container token differences

| Container token | Productive scale | Expressive scale |
|:---|:---|:---|
|`$container-01`|24px|32px|
|`$container-02`|32px|40px|
|`$container-03`|40px|48px|
|`$container-04`|48px|48px|
|`$container-05`|64px|72px|


We do not always used expressive variants of components however. Components with high interactivity levels benefit from being presented using the productive type styles. For example, Accordion, Filter panel, Mega menu, and Tabs.
