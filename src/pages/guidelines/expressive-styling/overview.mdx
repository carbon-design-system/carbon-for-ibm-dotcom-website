## Coming soon

The Carbon for IBM.com and Carbon teams are currently working to consolidate foundational assets into the one core library. 

| Asset                           | What's changing                       |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| _Carbon for IBM.com design kits_ | New design kits, in both Figma and Sketch, are currently in development. The kits will be available in all four themes and will include color tokens by theme, expressive and productive typestyles, and key components from the Carbon for IBM.com library.       |
| _Button, Link, List_            | These three core components will be added as expressive variants to the core Carbon library and will be available in the Carbon Sketch kit and Carbon repos from v11 forward. These components will also be in the new Carbon for IBM.com design kits, which will be available soon.        |
| _Type token names_              | The type token names are currently being updated to aid understanding and use. They will be updated in the Carbon v11 release, and we will provide updates when they're available in Carbon for IBM.com kits.            |

We will post updates, including next steps for using the core library assets. 

## What is expressive styling?

Expressive styling has been carefully designed and curated to serve people visiting IBM.com. It features larger type sizes and a more editorial approach to allows users to scan, read, and navigate multiple pages with comfort and ease. Specifically, expressive styling supports the following needs:

- Users are trying to learn and explore, and are primarily scanning and reading. 
- Interactions are more passive through impactful imagery, layout, and long form reading.
- Users typically traverse a series of pages during one session. 
- Key performance indicators consider success in terms of click-through rates and final purchases. 

Given these needs and interaction behaviors, the expressive styles are optimized to improve content hierarchy, visual engagement, and set clear expectations as user goes from page to page.

We've created detailed usage guidance for working with the productive and expressive type sets, explaining and illustrating where blending of the type sets can enhance experiences. Learn more on the [Styling strategies](../expressive-styling/styling-strategies) tab. 

## Expressive theme availability

<InlineNotification kind="warning">

**Note:** The Expressive theme is being integrated into Carbon Design System’s core library, and so expressive and productive styling will be available from one library source. After this change, the Expressive theme will no longer be maintained. <a href="../../help/expressive-update">Learn more about this change</a>.

</InlineNotification>

The Expressive theme is our initial attempt at achieving expressive styling. It works as a wrapper on top of Carbon's core library, and is enabled in in Carbon for IBM.com (starting in v1.10.0) by default, to guarantee consistency across all IBM.com experiences. 

The Expressive theme is also available as its own offering within the Carbon for IBM.com styles package (available in `v1.9.0`). Read more about how to implement the expressive theme [within any non-IBM.com applications](https://carbon-expressive.mybluemix.net).

As mentioned above, this current approach is changing soon. We will provide more details to ensure your transition is seamless.

## How the Expressive theme works

### Type scale

The Expressive theme increases Carbon Design System’s base type size of 14px to 16px and systematically increased the other type sizes within the system.

<Row>
<Column colMd={8} colLg={8}>

</Column>
</Row>


#### Type token differences

The following table shows the differences between the default Carbon tokens and the tokens used by the expressive theme.

| Type token | Carbon default scale (size/line-height) | Carbon Expressive scale (size/line-height) |
|:---|:---|:---|
|`$code-01`|12px / 16px|14px / 20px|
|`$code-02`|14px / 20px|16px / 24px|
|`$caption-01`|12px / 16px|14px / 18px|
|`$label-01`|12px / 16px|14px / 18px|
|`$helper-text-01`|12px / 16px|14px / 18px|
|`$body-short-01`|14px / 18px|16px / 22px|
|`$body-long-01`|14px / 20px|16px / 24px|
|`productive-heading-01`|14px / 18px|16px / 22px|


### Icons

To match the increased type size, the standard 16px by 16px icon size for Carbon's 14px base type has increased to 20px by 20px for the 16px base type in the Expressive theme.

<Row>
<Column colMd={8} colLg={8}>

#### Icon token differences

| Icon token | Productive scale | Expressive scale |
|:---|:---|:---|
|`$icon-01`|16px|20px|
|`$icon-02`|20px|20px|


### Containers

Container sizes were increased systematically to accommodate the larger type sizes. The default container size for most components increased from 40px to 48px.
