As an inclusive IBM, it is crucial that we design and build online experiences for all. The need for right-to-left (RTL) web experiences continues to grow. Arabic, a RTL language, is the 4th most popular language globally.

## LTR and RTL
The differentiation between left-to-right (LTR) and right-to-left (RTL) language script is the content is display in opposite directions.

* Right-to-left (RTL) languages display and read text from right to left. (e.g., include Arabic, Hebrew, Persian)
* Left-to-right (LTR) languages display and read text from left to right. (e.g., German, French, English)

## Mirroring content
To begin designing a right-to-left RTL webpage, you start by flipping the navigation, page layout, graphics from the left-to-right LTR interface. This method is often referred to as mirroring. UI can be mirrored vice versa, from left-to-right to right-to-left, but not all elements are one to one. 

**Elements changed when mirroring UI:**
* Directional icons are mirrored (e.g., back and forward arrows)
* Text field icons are mirrored on the opposite side of a field
* Form fields are right aligned 
* Navigation buttons are reserve ordered
* RTL text are right aligned 
* Elements displaying the sequence of time are mirrored (e.g., timelines or progress indictors)

**Elements not changed when mirroring UI:**
* Untranslated text in LTR languages 
* Product logos
* Video/audio player controls 
* Data visualization (e.g., charts, graphs)
* Numerical digits (e.g., phone numbers, addresses and international dialing codes)
* URL links

## Typography 
With right-to-left (RTL) languages typography is read from right to left, because of this all text is right aligned. Right-to-left languages, such as Arabic, require attention to detail when designing. 

**Keep in mind the following:**
* In Arabic and other RTL languages, most words are shorter in length than words in English.
* Left-to-right languages don't change their direction when displayed on RTL webpages.

  </Column>

</Row>

**Things to avoid:**
* Common abbreviations such as days of the week and months (e.g., Mon, Tues, Jan, Dec) in English are not appropriate in Arabic and other right-to-left languages.
* Numerical digits such as phone numbers, addresses and international dialing codes are not mirrored.
* Avoid bold typefaces.

## Icons
Icon use in RTL can be challenging. Some icons may need to be mirrored and others not mirror. Some icons may be considered disrespectful to those of different nationalities with right-to-left languages. Make sure the icons you are using make sense and are culturally appropriate. 

### When to mirror 
Forward and backward buttons are the icons t require mirroring in right-to-left, as these icons represent direction to the user. Other icons that require mirroring are icons signify movement or represent text direction. 

#### Directional icons
Direction specific icons are mirrored (e.g., forward and backward arrows).

#### Text icons
Icons that represent the direction of text are mirrored (e.g., text alignment icons, bullet point icons etc.).

#### Movement icons
Mirror icons that signify movement or forward motion are mirrored (e.g., airplane, bike, car).

### When not to mirror
Mirroring icons in a right-to-left interface should be done carefully because most icons will not require mirroring. The following icons listed below do not require mirroring:

**Logo and brand**
Do not mirror any icons that are a logo or brand representation (e.g., Carbon, Watson, Security).

<Row>
 <Column colMd={4} colLg={4} >
   <DoDontExample type="do" >

 ![Icon slash ](../../images/guidelines/right-to-left/logo-icon-do.jpg)

   </DoDontExample>
 </Column>  
 <Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>
   <DoDontExample >

 ![Icon slash ](../../images/guidelines/right-to-left/logo-icon-do-not.jpg)

   </DoDontExample>
 </Column>
 </Row>
 
 <br/>

**Symmetrical icons**
Do not mirror symmetrical or non-direction specific icons (e.g., camera, download, export).

<br/>

**Clock icons**
Although elements displaying the sequence of time should be mirrored, icons representing a clock should not be mirrored. In RTL languages, clocks still turn clockwise just as LTR. 

<Row>
 <Column colMd={4} colLg={4} >
   <DoDontExample type="do" >

 ![Icon slash ](../../images/guidelines/right-to-left/clock-icon-do.jpg)

   </DoDontExample>
 </Column>  
 <Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>
   <DoDontExample >

 ![Icon slash ](../../images/guidelines/right-to-left/clock-icon-do-not.jpg)

   </DoDontExample>
 </Column>
 </Row>
 
 <br/>

**Right handed object icons**
Any icon that represents an object that would be held in the right hand should not be mirrored (e.g., paint brush, scissors, search). Right-handedness is most common worldwide, as it is estimate around 90% of the world's population is right-handed.

<Row>
 <Column colMd={4} colLg={4} >
   <DoDontExample type="do" >

 ![Icon slash ](../../images/guidelines/right-to-left/right-handed-icon-do-1.jpg)

   </DoDontExample>
 </Column>  
 <Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>
   <DoDontExample >

 ![Icon slash ](../../images/guidelines/right-to-left/right-handed-icon-do-not-1.jpg)

   </DoDontExample>
 </Column>
 </Row>
 
 <Row>
 <Column colMd={4} colLg={4} >
   <DoDontExample type="do" >

 ![Icon slash ](../../images/guidelines/right-to-left/right-handed-icon-do-2.jpg)

   </DoDontExample>
 </Column>  
 <Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>
   <DoDontExample >

 ![Icon slash ](../../images/guidelines/right-to-left/right-handed-icon-do-not-2.jpg)

   </DoDontExample>
 </Column>
 </Row>
 
 <br/>

**Icons with words**
Do not mirror icons with LTR language, rather localize the icon by adding the correct RTL language into the icon (e.g., PDF in English should be localized).

<Row>
 <Column colMd={4} colLg={4} >
   <DoDontExample type="do" >

 ![Icon slash ](../../images/guidelines/right-to-left/icon-with-words-do.jpg)

   </DoDontExample>
 </Column>  
 <Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>
   <DoDontExample >

 ![Icon slash ](../../images/guidelines/right-to-left/icon-with-words-do-not.jpg)

   </DoDontExample>
 </Column>
 </Row>
 
<br/>

**Icons with slashes**
Icons that include a slash should not be mirrored. Slash icons are usually commonly grouped with toggle icons (e.g., microphone-off, notification-off).

<Row>
 <Column colMd={4} colLg={4} >
   <DoDontExample type="do" >

 ![Icon slash ](../../images/guidelines/right-to-left/icon-slash-do.jpg)

   </DoDontExample>
 </Column>  
 <Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>
   <DoDontExample >

 ![Icon slash ](../../images/guidelines/right-to-left/icon-slash-do-not.jpg)

   </DoDontExample>
 </Column>
 </Row>

### Culturally appropriate
Icons that may be problematic in RTL but appropriate in LTR, are a wine glass to represent a restaurant or a piggy bank to symbolize frugality. Double check that the meaning of the icons being used are consistent within RTL languages. To clarify icon meaning, reach out to a native speaker for cultural perspective. 

## Other elements 
With many elements and components on a webpage it can be hard to know which should be mirrored in RTL. The following lists out what elements and components to mirror and not mirror on a RTL webpage. 

* **Breadcrumbs** – Breadcrumbs should be right aligned on the page and mirrored.
* **Calendars** – Calendars should be mirrored. Sunday will be displayed on the far left while Monday will been the right side. 
* **Tables** – Columns of tables should be mirrored. 
* **Form fields** – Icons and headings that reference a field in a form should be mirrored on RTL websites.
* **Dates** – Some RTL languages have their own specific calendar, most RTL users are familiar with conventional international date format. 
* **Video and audio players** – Video and audio players should not be mirrored because they refer to playback progress, not the sequence of time.
