## IBM.com guidelines

| Guidelines                                                                                  |  Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| [Content](https://www.ibm.com/standards/carbon/guidelines/content)                          | Consistency is really important when it comes to writing content. With so many different people writing content, messages can be hard to understand for a viewer. That’s why there are content guidelines – so that no matter where a viewer is on the website, they experience the same “look and feel” of the content. This consistency also helps to build a brand, brand loyalty and ultimately sales. |
| [Right-to-left language](https://www.ibm.com/standards/carbon/guidelines/right-to-left)     | As an inclusive IBM, it is crucial that we design and build online experiences for all. The need for right-to-left (RTL) web experiences continues to grow. Arabic, a right-to-left language, is the 4th most popular language globally.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| [Expressive theme](https://www.ibm.com/standards/carbon/guidelines/expressive-theme)        | The Expressive Theme is a flavor of Carbon for IBM.com and web experiences, optimized for the reading and learning experiences, among the most common in web experiences.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| [Style models](https://www.ibm.com/standards/carbon/guidelines/style-models/overview)       | The IBM.com style models provide a design framework that defines the foundational structures for IBM.com pages with the goal of creating consistent and coherent experiences across users’ journeys in a scalable way.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| [Layout](https://www.ibm.com/standards/carbon/guidelines/layout)                            | A good layout helps users navigate complex information, understand the content presented, and complete their goals. This is achieved by organizing and arranging various elements using tools such as the 2x grid, visual anchors, typography and motion, among others.                                                                                                                                    |

## Core guidelines

Here are some essential guidelines to help you design with consistency and quality.

| Guidelines                                                                               |  Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [2x Grid](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/2x-grid/overview/)               | It’s fundamental to everything we design. The 2x Grid is the geometric foundation of all the visual elements of IBM Design, from typography to columns, boxes, icons, and illustrations. It provides structure and guidance for all creative decision-making.                                     |
| [Accessibility](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/accessibility/overview)    | IBM firmly believes that web and software experiences should be accessible for everyone, regardless of abilities or impairments. IBM is committed to following and complying with best practices when it comes to accessibility.                                                                  |
| [Content](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/content/overview/)               | Content design can make or break an online experience. Always strive for writing that is clear, concise, and on-brand.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| [Color](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/color/overview)                    | Maintaining consistent and engaging digital interfaces throughout IBM, whether applications or experiences, demands extended guidance around color usage. The following concepts are the foundation as we strive to achieve balance and harmony through our User Interface design.                |
| [Icons](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/icons/library)                     | Icons are visual symbols used to represent ideas, objects, or actions. They communicate messages at a glance, afford interactivity, and draw attention to important information.                                                                                                                  |
| [Pictograms](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/pictograms/library)           | IBM’s pictograms are visual symbols used to represent ideas, objects, or narratives. They can communicate messages at a glance, afford interactivity, and simplify complex ideas. They draw from details found in the Plex typeface and work well in presentations and marketing communications.  |
| [Motion](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/motion/overview/)                 | Motion can bring the screen to life, guide users through complex experiences, and help move them forward—from here to there, now to next, start to finish—and make progress.                                                                                                                      |
| [Spacing](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/spacing/overview/)               | Spacing is an important — and often overlooked — part of visual design. IBM takes a lot of the guesswork out of spacing to help designers deliver clear, functional layouts.                                                                                                                      |
| [Themes](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/themes/overview/)                 | Themes are used to customize component styles to fit the specific aesthetic of a brand or product.                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| [Typography](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/typography/overview)          | Typography can help create clear hierarchies, organize information, and guide users through a product or experience.                                                                                                                                                                              |
