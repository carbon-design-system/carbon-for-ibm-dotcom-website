| Guidelines                            | Description                                                                                                             |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [2x Grid](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/2x-grid/basics)     | It’s fundamental to everything we design. The 2x Grid is the geometric foundation of all the visual elements of IBM Design, from typography to columns, boxes, icons, and illustrations. It provides structure and guidance for all creative decision-making. |
| [Accessibility](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/accessibility/overview)   | IBM firmly believes that web and software experiences should be accessible for everyone, regardless of abilities or impairments. Carbon is committed to following and complying with best practices when it comes to accessibility.                                       |
| [Content](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/content/general)               | Content design can make or break an online experience. Always strive for writing that is clear, concise, and on-brand.                     |
| [Color](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/color/overview)    | Maintaining consistent and engaging digital interfaces throughout IBM, whether applications or experiences, demands extended guidance around color usage. The following concepts are the foundation as we strive to achieve balance and harmony through our User Interface design.                 |
| [Icons](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/icons/library)               | Icons are visual symbols used to represent ideas, objects, or actions. They communicate messages at a glance, afford interactivity, and draw attention to important information.                     |
| [Pictograms](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/pictograms/library)               | IBM’s pictograms are visual symbols used to represent ideas, objects, or narratives. They can communicate messages at a glance, afford interactivity, and simplify complex ideas. They draw from details found in the Plex typeface and work well in presentations and marketing communications.                    |
| [Motion](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/motion/basics)               | Motion can bring the screen to life, guide users through complex experiences, and help move them forward—from here to there, now to next, start to finish—and make progress.                    |
| [Spacing](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/spacing)               | Spacing is an important — and often overlooked — part of visual design. Carbon takes a lot of the guesswork out of spacing to help designers deliver clear, functional layouts.                     |
| [Themes](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/themes)               | Themes are used to customize component styles to fit the specific aesthetic of a brand or product.                     |
| [Typography](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/typography/overview)               | Typography can help create clear hierarchies, organize information, and guide users through a product or experience.                     |

## Principles 
* **Unified:** A component of a greater IBM design practice and should contribute positively to the IBM Design System and IBM Design Language.
* **Universal:** Used by a wide range of IBM.com teams and organizations. Our guidelines language should be welcoming and accessible.
* **Conversational:** Crafted with an adopter in mind, it should allow us to communicate in colloquial, natural language.
* **Contribution:** They are a living document and your input is how we can grow in scale. The [Documentation page](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/how-to-contribute/documentation) includes details on contributing to the Carbon Design System and Carbon for IBM.com communities.
