## Why do we need guidelines?
The IBM.com site has experienced tremendous growth over the years. It now consists of millions of pages and functions, so it has become clear that we were in need of a more systematic methodology. This is required to guide and leverage our collective efforts to make the overall IBM.com experience more meaningful for our users, while remaining consistent across all teams and offerings. We put forward these guidelines and best practices to streamline our decision-making so we can work more efficiently, cohesively and uniformly. 

## Principles 
* **Unified:** A component of a greater IBM design practice and should contribute positively to the IBM Design System and IBM Design Language.
* **Universal:** Used by a wide range of IBM.com teams and organizations. Our guidelines language should be welcoming and accessible.
* **Conversational:** Crafted with an adopter in mind, it should allow us to communicate in colloquial, natural language.
* **Contribution:** They are a living document and your input is how we can grow in scale. The [Documentation page](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/how-to-contribute/documentation) includes details on contributing to the Carbon Design System and Carbon for IBM.com communities.
