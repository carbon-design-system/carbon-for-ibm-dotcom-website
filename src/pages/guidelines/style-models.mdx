## What are style models?

Style model connects a specific usage of design elements (grid, colors, typography, etc) to the kind of content it best serves. For example, all pages on IBM.com uses the <a href="https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/2x-grid/overview/" target="_blank">2x Grid</a>, but the 2x Grid still supports a wide range of behaviors. It can be used with or without max width, left aligned or centered. These design decisions should be consistently based on content needs.

Here is the list of existing style models identified so far.

| Page content                                | Example usage                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| [Editorial model](#editorial-model)         | Marketing content falls into this category. Think expressive styling and shorter sessions of visits. This covers models previously known as "Editorial navigation", "Listing", "Reading", and "Information gathering"                                                                           |
| [Dashboard model](#dashboard-model)         | Product interfaces and data visualization dashboards fall into this category, where every inch of the screen needs be utilized at maximum to display information. Users egage with these screens for longer period of time and often actively interacting.                                      |
| [Documentation model](#documentation-model) | Documentation presents a unique combination of needs - controlled line lengths, but also a long duration egnagement. Examples of documentation include IBM Docs, Cloud Docs, and this site documentating the design system guidance. This covers models previously known as "Index navigation". |
| Transactional model                         | For checkout, forms. Commonly occuring in e-commerce and registration. This covers models previously known as "Transation" and "Simple transaction"                                                                                                                                             |

## Editorial model

When used on editorial content, the max width (1584px, or 99rem) should be applied to ensure texts and Call to actions are not drifting to the pereferal for visitors using a big screen. This ensures a complete first impression of the content. Applying a max width to the page also keeps text line length at a reasonable width, which allows for <a href="https://www.ibm.com/design/language/typography/type-basics/#comfortable-reading" target="_blank">comfortable reading</a>.

These user intents and style models are not set in stoneâ€”they and are intended to evolve over time.
