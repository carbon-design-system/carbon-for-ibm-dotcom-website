## Overview

Style models help designers by simplifying decisions around how foundational design elements should be used. For example, all pages on IBM.com uses the <a href="https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/2x-grid/overview/" target="_blank">2x Grid</a>, but the 2x Grid supports a wide range of behaviors and usage. It can be used with or without max width, left aligned or centered. These design decisions should be made consistently based on content needs. Style models connect specific usage combinations to the kind of content it best serves. In our models, the design elements included are:

- Grid
- Screen regions
- Key components (Masthead, Footer)

Here is a list of recurring style models we have identified so far.

| Style models                                                    | Usage and examples                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| [_Documentation model_](#documentation-model)                   | For long form content with deep organizational hierarchy, use the Documentation model. It anticipates a left hand navigational panel, and keeps content within a maximum width. Examples of documentation include IBM Docs, Cloud Docs, and this site documenting the design system guidance.                                                |
| [_High density interface model_](#high-density-interface-model) | Sometimes every inch of the screen needs be utilized at maximum to display information and controls. Complex product interfaces and data visualization dashboards typically fall into this category. This model uses the full width grid, so the bigger the screen, the more information the user will see.                                  |

#### &#12288;

The biggest differentiator between the models is the grid. Specifically in how grid behaves above max breakpoint. Below is the 2x Grid at max breakpoint (1584px or 99rem).

<br />

<Row>
<Column colLg={2} colMd={2}>

**2x Grid at max breakpoint**<br/>

</Column>
<Column colLg={10} colMd={6}>

![2x Grid at max breakpoint](../../images/guidelines/style-models/grid-at-max.png)

</Column>
</Row>

#### &#12288;

Once the screen is wider than the max breakpoint, the margins (highlighted in dark blue below) can expand, or the grid can stretch.

<br />

<Row>
<Column colLg={2} colMd={2}>

**Editorial**<br/> Max width kept, centered grid

</Column>
<Column colLg={10} colMd={6}>

![Editorial model grid](../../images/guidelines/style-models/grid-above-max--editorial.png)

</Column>
</Row>
<Row>
<Column colLg={2} colMd={2}>

**Documentation**<br/> Max width kept, grid left aligned

</Column>
<Column colLg={10} colMd={6}>

![Documentation model grid](../../images/guidelines/style-models/grid-above-max--doc.png)

</Column>
</Row>
<Row>
<Column colLg={2} colMd={2}>

**High density interface**<br/> Full width, grid stetches

</Column>
<Column colLg={10} colMd={6}>

![High density interface model grid](../../images/guidelines/style-models/grid-above-max--dash.png)

</Column>
</Row>

<br />

This difference in grid ripples through everything on page. Here is an overview of how the Masthead and Footer will behave above max breakpoints:

<Row>
<Column colMd={4} colLg={4} >

![Dotcom shell on editorial model](../../images/guidelines/style-models/style-models-dotcom-shell-1.png)

<Caption>

The **editorial model** demonstrates the default behavior. The content within the components is contained in the max width, but background colors and dividers span the full width.

</Caption>

</Column>
<Column colMd={4} colLg={4} >

![Dotcom shell on documentation model](../../images/guidelines/style-models/style-models-dotcom-shell-2.png)

<Caption>

The **documentation model** has left-aligned content in the footer, while the background is full width. Masthead breaks from the grid, and both content and background span the full width.

</Caption>

</Column>
<Column colMd={4} colLg={4} >

![Dotcom shell on high density interface model](../../images/guidelines/style-models/style-models-dotcom-shell-3.png)

<Caption>

The **high density interface model** shows both masthead and footer obeying the grid as expected, stretching to full width of screen.

</Row>

## Editorial model

This default style model is the bread and butter of marketing pages, which represent the majority of IBM.com. The grid in this model centers content for most comfortable browsing, and allows for a variety of expressive layouts. Some low information density product screens, such as the Checkout application, can use this model too.

### Grid

For editorial content, the max width should always be applied. This ensures text and calls to action do not drift to the periphery for visitors using a big screen, and provides a complete first impression of the content. Applying a max width to the page also keeps text line length at a reasonable width, which allows for <a href="https://www.ibm.com/design/language/typography/type-basics/#comfortable-reading" target="_blank">comfortable reading</a>.

<Row>
<Column colMd={4} colLg={4} >
<DoDontExample type="do" caption="Editorial model uses max width to keep content centralized.">

![Editorial model uses max width](../../images/guidelines/style-models/style-models-editorial-do-dont-1.png)

</DoDontExample>
</Column>
<Column colMd={4} colLg={4} >
<DoDontExample type="dont" caption="Without max width content stretches and drifts apart on wide screens.">

![Without max width content stretches and drifts apart on wide screens](../../images/guidelines/style-models/style-models-editorial-do-dont-2.png)

</DoDontExample>
</Column>
</Row>

The grid should also be centered when the screen width is larger than max width to present content front and center. A left aligned grid creates a awkward white space on the right that draws unnecessary attention.

<Row>
<Column colMd={4} colLg={4} >
<DoDontExample type="dont" caption="Left aligned grid creates awkward white space on the right that draws unnecessary attention.">

![Don't use left aligned grid](../../images/guidelines/style-models/style-models-editorial-do-dont-3.png)

</DoDontExample>
</Column>
</Row>

### Screen regions and Dotcom shell

Begin designing by parsing through the content for hierarchies, and start with the most essential, overarching concepts at the top, then adding the main details of the subject matter, and positioning the related or supportive content at the bottom. Try to consider the mobile layout first because it forces us to be disciplined in sequencing content in a logical order.

Refer to the `Guidelines > Layout` page for more guidance on [Content hierarchy](/guidelines/layout#content-hierarchy).

<Row>
<Column colMd={8} colLg={8} >

![Lorem ipsum](../../images/guidelines/style-models/style-models-editorial-screen-regions.png)

<Caption>
  1. Global element: Masthead <br />
  2. Overarching content: headings, titles, or leading sentences <br />
  3. Main content: details of the subject matter <br />
  4. Related content: helpful links, related topics <br />
  5. Global element: Footer <br />
</Caption>

</Column>
</Row>

Masthead and footer together make up the shell of the page, also known as [Dotcom shell](/components/dotcom-shell). How they are positioned on the grid helps to define the expectations for the rest of the page. In the Editorial model, Dotcom shell stays on the grid. This means the content elements are aligned to columns, and background colors and their dividers are full width extending into margins.

<Row>
<Column colMd={4} colLg={4} >

![Dotcom shell usage on grid](../../images/guidelines/style-models/style-models-dotcom-shell-1.png)

<Caption>

</Column>
</Row>

## Documentation model

For long form content with deep organizational hierarchy, use the Documentation model. It anticipates a left hand navigational panel, and keeps content within a maximum width. Examples of documentation include IBM Docs, Cloud Docs, and this site documenting the design system guidance.
### Grid

Documentation sites deal with large volumes of text and media content. It benefits from a persistent navigation to help with organization and way finding. This reduces the main content area to 12 columns, but allows for the holistic design to embrace the 4 <a href="https://carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/2x-grid/overview/#key-lines" target="_blank">key lines</a>.

Do not use a <a href="https://carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/2x-grid/overview/#grid-influencers" target="_blank">grid influencer</a> for the navigation panel because it should be present most of the time. Reserve grid influencers for temporary UI elements because when present, the grid influencer breaks a layout where everything is divisible by two.

<Row>
<Column colMd={4} colLg={4} >
<DoDontExample type="do" caption="Documentation benefits from a persistant navigation that takes up 4 columns and a controlled max width.">

![Documentation benefits from a persistent navigation that takes up 4 columns and a controlled max width.](../../images/guidelines/style-models/style-models-docu-1.png)

</DoDontExample>
</Column>
<Column colMd={4} colLg={4} >
<DoDontExample type="dont" caption="Grid influencer breaks a layout where everything is divisible by two.">

![Content on page doesn't align to the 4 key lines](../../images/guidelines/style-models/style-models-docu-2.png)

</DoDontExample>
</Column>
</Row>

Left aligning the grid allows the navigation to anchor to the side of the screen, and keeps the main content at a predictable proximity to the navigation.

<Row>
<Column colMd={4} colLg={4} >
<DoDontExample type="do" caption="Reserve the first 3 columns on the left for navigation panel, and place main content on the 5th–16th columns. ">

![Correct placement of content on grid in Documentation model](../../images/guidelines/style-models/style-models-docu-3.png)

</DoDontExample>
</Column>
<Column colMd={4} colLg={4} >
<DoDontExample type="dont" caption="Grid influencer is not recommended for documentation because grid influencer temporarily breaks the 2x Grid logic, and should not be a persistent element on screen.">

![Grid influencer is not recommended for documentation](../../images/guidelines/style-models/style-models-docu-4.png)

</DoDontExample>
</Column>
</Row>

### Screen regions and Dotcom shell

The left hand navigation panel is similar to a table of contents, which hides on smaller screens.

<Row>
<Column colMd={8} colLg={8} >

![Lorem ipsum](../../images/guidelines/style-models/style-models-docu-screen-regions.png)

<Caption>
  1. Global element: Masthead <br />
  2. Overarching content: page navigation <br />
  3. Main content: details of the subject matter <br />
  4. Related content: helpful links, related topics <br />
  5. Global element: Footer <br />
</Caption>

</Column>
</Row>

With the documentation model, the Dotcom shell breaks out of the grid and is full width. This keeps the right side of the Masthead elements (Search and Account functions) anchored to the screen edge.

<Row>
<Column colMd={4} colLg={4} >

![Dotcom shell usage on Documentation model](../../images/guidelines/style-models/style-models-dotcom-shell-2.png)

<Caption>
  In Documentation model, Masthead breaks from the grid and is full width, while
  Footer sticks to grid.
</Caption>

</Column>
</Row>

## High density interface model

Sometimes every inch of the screen needs be utilized at maximum to display information and controls. Complex product interfaces and data visualization dashboards typically fall into this category. This model uses the full width grid, so the bigger the screen, the more information the user will see.

At IBM.com, we have not yet encountered this use case. If your content fits this category, and is not external facing, consdier using <a href="https://carbondesignsystem.com/" target="_blank">Carbon Design System</a>.

### Grid

The effect of having a max width is not visible at smaller screens. But once the screen is wider than 99rem, the presence of a max width will limit the amount of content shown, and create large empty spaces at the same time. Considering the goal is to display maximum content, large empty spaces can be a frustrating experience.

<Row>
<Column colMd={4} colLg={4} >
<DoDontExample type="do" caption="For high density interfaces, utilize the full screen width to present as much information as possible.">

![High density interface uses max width](../../images/guidelines/style-models/style-models-dashboard-do-dont-1.png)

</DoDontExample>
</Column>
<Column colMd={4} colLg={4} >
<DoDontExample type="dont" caption="Containing high density interfaces in a max width creates frustration.">

![Without max width content stretches and drifts apart on wide screens](../../images/guidelines/style-models/style-models-dashboard-do-dont-2.png)

</DoDontExample>
</Column>
</Row>

### Screen regions and Dotcom shell

If you are using Carbon Design System, reference there are existing guidance on Carbon website that covers <a href="https://carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/2x-grid/overview/#screen-regions" target="_blank">screen regions</a>.

In place of Dotcom shell, Carbon Design System offers the <a href="https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/UI-shell-header/usage/" target="_blank">UI shell</a> as the default header.

If you have to use Carbon for IBM.com &mdash; perhaps because your application is external facing, and integrated with marketing content &mdash; you can use the Dotcom shell as well. In this this case, Dotcom shell follows the grid and stretches to full width.

<Row>
