## Content foundations

The following are guidelines on how to create effective content. For starters, here are some of the most common rules:

- Keep sentences as short and simple as possible – typically 25 or fewer words.
- If it doesn’t impact meaning, use a shorter or more common word instead of a longer or more technical word (e.g.:
  “use” instead of “utilize”).
- Avoid slang, jargon, sarcasm, emoticons and country (or regional) colloquialisms.
- Be succinct and avoid redundant and unnecessary text.
- In general, use a complete sentence to introduce a list. Introduce procedures with a sentence, an infinitive phrase,
  or a heading.

While you’ll find the most common content guidelines here, refer to these two sources for more in-depth information:

## Voice and tone

### Voice

Voice in writing expresses the core of a company's personality. Whether spoken
or written, one of the most important characteristics of IBM is our unique brand
voice. Our verbal identity must remain as recognizable to everyone as our visual
identity.

Understanding IBM's personality and voice will help you reach for the best words
as you develop content.

IBM Brand Center offers the following guidelines on voice.

#### When IBM content is at its best:

- It has a clear point of view.
- It’s simple and logical.
- It builds on solid research, data, and analysis.
- It’s intellectually ambitious, expressing a bigger idea.
- It’s persuasive, not poetic.
- It’s confident, but not boastful.
- It only ever uses figurative language for emphasis.
- It elevates facts and outcomes.
- It engages the thinker by speaking like the thinker.

For additional guidance, please read the IBM Brand Center
[voice guidelines](https://www.ibm.com/brand/expression#voice).

### Tone

Tone describes how the IBM voice is expressed, and as such it can adapt to
different situations. For example, the words chosen for error messages differ
greatly from words you might see in an onboarding flow. The tone of error
messages is economical and direct, and they are often written in short phrases
instead of sentences. Onboarding flows typically take a little more time, with
full sentences and friendly explanations.

The underlying voice in each case is consistent but with different word choices
and a different sentence structure, the style and tone adapts.

## Capitalization

**Use sentence-case capitalization for all UI text elements.** This style is predominantly lowercase. Capitalize only
the initial letter of the first word in the text and other words that require capitalization, such as proper nouns. For
example, labels in a table would be written as “First name” and “Email address”. Unless the name is a product or service
name, or is trademarked, always use sentence-style capitalization.

**Do not use title case capitalization.** Title (or headline) case capitalization is where the first letter of most
words is capitalized, but not articles, conjunctions, or prepositions (except if any of these are the first or last word
in the sentence or phrase). Instead, use sentence-case capitalization.

**Do not use all caps capitalization.** All caps (or uppercase) capitalization is where every letter is capitalized.

#### Use capital letters for:

- “IBM” or any other company or organization name
- Any official, trademarked product or service (whether from IBM or not) – unless they intentionally use a lowercase
  letter at the beginning, such as the iPhone
- Any initialisms (for example, BBC, HTML) or acronyms (for example, NASA, NATO)
- Any people
- Any country or place names
- Referring to any UI labels that are themselves capitalized
- When the word begins a sentence or phrase

If it’s not in the list above, it should not be capitalized. Capitalize proper nouns, such as the names of people,
places, and products are proper nouns and therefore all take initial capitals.

## Pronouns

In general, use the second person (you, your) as often as possible.

Use the first person in headings or labels that are very specific to the user or customer data, for example “My account”
or “My usage.” However, in explanatory text for the heading or label, switch to second person. For example, “Your usage
is calculated from the first day of the month.”

Where appropriate, use first person (we, our) to refer to IBM. For example, in requests for personal information, such
as name and email address, where the user will benefit from knowing why IBM is asking for this information. Example:
“Why do we need your email address?”

Avoid third-person pronouns that are gender specific.

## Character count standards

### Character count sizes

The following character count sizes should be used for all components and patterns when setting text content.

| Name  | Size (English) | Size (translated) |
| :---- | :------------- | :---------------- |
| Micro | 20             | 32                |
| Mini  | 25             | 35                |
| XXS   | 40             | 55                |
| XS    | 65             | 85                |
| S     | 75             | 100               |
| M     | 120            | 150               |
| L     | 150            | 200               |
| LL    | 200            | 260               |
| XL    | 250            | 325               |
| XXL   | 350            | 450               |

### Translation conversion table

The following table provides a good indication of the amount of additional space needed to contain a text passage after
translation. This is the official statement about string length calculation for translations, according to Rule A3 in <a target="_blank" href="http://w3-03.ibm.com/globalization/page/4619">IBM Globalization Design Guide</a>.

The numbers represent statistical averages. In some situations they will be overly generous, while in others the
translator will have difficulty fitting in all the translated words. Ideally the translator can use any amount of space,
but use the following list as a rough guide to the space that should be left for MRI expansion:

| Number of characters in text | Additional physical space required |
| :--------------------------- | :--------------------------------- |
| Up to 10                     | 100% to 200%                       |
| 11 to 20                     | 80% to 100%                        |
| 21 to 30                     | 60% to 80%                         |
| 31 to 50                     | 40% to 60%                         |
| 51 to 70                     | 31% to 40%                         |
| Over 70                      | 30%                                |

## Inclusive language

IBM is committed to eliminating language that supports racial, cultural, or gender bias. It is critical that all words used in any capacity in product offerings be inclusive in their language.

IBMers who are unsure about a particular word can search the <a href="http://ibm.biz/termsearch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IBM Terminology database</a>, and can also <a href="http://tlwi.w3-969.ibm.com/standards/terminology/feedbackform2.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">submit a term for review</a>.

For more information about this important work, see the <a href="https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/inclusive-it-terminology/take-action" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Inclusive IT Terminology</a> site.

## Writing for accessibility

For detailed guidance about writing for all users, please read the
[Content design section](https://www.ibm.com/able/toolkit/design/content/text-equivalents)
of the IBM Accessibility site.

It provides detailed guidance on the following topics:

- text alternatives for visuals or audio content
- errors and other messages
- labels and inputs for forms
- guidance for providing adequate context

Further guidance can be found in the
[Web Content Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/)
[guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/).
