## Content foundations
The following are guidelines on how to create effective content. For starters, here are some of the most common rules:

- Keep sentences as short and simple as possible – typically 25 or fewer words.
- If it doesn’t impact meaning, use a shorter or more common word instead of a longer or more technical word (e.g.: “use” instead of “utilize”).
- Avoid slang, jargon, sarcasm, emoticons and country (or regional) colloquialisms. 
- Be succinct and avoid redundant and unnecessary text.
- In general, use a complete sentence to introduce a list. Introduce procedures with a sentence, an infinitive phrase, or a heading.

While you’ll find the most common content guidelines here, refer to these two sources for more in-depth information:

## Voice and tone
When crafting content for IBM.com website pages, the content tone should sound like you are speaking to a respected professional acquaintance, using clear language and short declarative sentences. Text should educate or persuade readers, not dazzle them with verbal acrobatics. A casual and conversational tone is acceptable and appropriate; overly informal language, slang, jargon, and disparaging or heavily opinionated comments are not.

In general, the writing style should always be simple, clear, and easy to understand. Using everyday language keeps the tone friendly, human, and inviting. Choose short words over long impressive-sounding words.

## Writing for accessibility
Accessibility is the successful access to information and use of information technology by people who have disabilities. Content for IBM.com website pages must be accessible. 

Here are a few best practices for accessibility:

- Avoid complex language, auto-playing animations and videos, and flashing animations. 
- Designs should pass usability heuristics, such as cognitive walkthroughs, to ensure users do not feel overloaded when completing tasks.
- Ask yourself whether the visual information translated effectively into text. Can an image be understood through its metadata alone?

## Specific style guidelines
Here are some common topics about style guidelines for IBM.com website pages:

- Capitalization
- Inclusive terminology
- Pronouns
- Active and passive voice

### Capitalization
**Use sentence-case capitalization for all UI text elements.** This style is predominantly lowercase. Capitalize only the initial letter of the first word in the text and other words that require capitalization, such as proper nouns. For example, labels in a table would be written as “First name” and “Email address”. Unless the name is a product or service name, or is trademarked, always use sentence-style capitalization.

**Do not use title case capitalization.** Title (or headline) case capitalization is where the first letter of most words is capitalized, but not articles, conjunctions, or prepositions (except if any of these are the first or last word in the sentence or phrase). Instead, use sentence-case capitalization.

**Do not use all caps capitalization.** All caps (or uppercase) capitalization is where every letter is capitalized.

**Please use capital letters for:**

- “IBM” or any other company or organization name
- Any official, trademarked product or service (whether from IBM or not) – unless  they intentionally use a lowercase letter at the beginning, such as the iPhone
- Any initialisms (for example, BBC, HTML) or acronyms (for example, NASA, NATO)
- Any people
- Any country or place names
- Referring to any UI labels that are themselves capitalized
- When the word begins a sentence or phrase

If it’s not in the list above, it should not be capitalized. Capitalize proper nouns, such as the names of people, places, and products are proper nouns and therefore all take initial capitals. 

### Inclusive language
Inclusive language is when you avoid using expressions or words that might exclude particular groups of people and make them feel alienated or uncomfortable. It is critical that content on IBM.com use inclusive language. The following guidelines will help you improve the inclusiveness of the website:
- The terms “blacklist” and “whitelist” are prohibited for future use. Instead, use the terms “blocklist” and “allowlist”. To refer to the action of adding items to a blocklist or allowlist, use the verbs “block” and “allow”.
- The term “slave” is prohibited in all IBM content, along with the term “master” in the sense of “superior”. Instead of slave, use another term such as “worker”, “child”, “helper”, “replica”, or “secondary”. Instead of “master,” use a term such as “controller”, “leader”, “manager”, “main”, “coordinator”, “parent”, or “primary”.

Inclusive writing also means avoiding gender bias. Do not assume that the subject of a sentence is male if the context might refer to any gender. Thus, instead of using “man hours”, use “labor hours” or “person hours”.

Sometimes you can rewrite a sentence to use the second person (“you”). For example, instead of writing “The user can now move his cursor in four directions”, write “You can now move your cursor in four directions”. It is also acceptable to use “they” to refer to a singular subject.

If you are unsure about a particular word, search the <a href="https://w3.ibm.com/standards/terminology/cgi-bin/lookup.pl?user_group=corporate" target="_blank">IBM Terminology database</a>.

### Pronouns
In general, use the second person (you, your) as often as possible.

Use the first person in headings or labels that are very specific to the user or customer data, for example “My account” or “My usage.” However, in explanatory text for the heading or label, switch to second person. For example, “Your usage is calculated from the first day of the month.”

Where appropriate, use first person (we, our) to refer to IBM. For example, in requests for personal information, such as name and email address, where the user will benefit from knowing why IBM is asking for this information. Example: “Why do we need your email address?”

Avoid third-person pronouns that are gender specific.

For more detailed guidance about pronouns, refer to the <a href="https://www-03preprod.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/ibm_style/pronouns.html" target="_blank">Pronouns</a> topic in IBM Style.

### Active and passive voice
The active voice is direct and emphasizes the subject of the sentence. For example, “John ate the apple”. 

The passive voice, on the other hand, flips the construction so that the subject is secondary to the verb and object. Often, the subject is not even included in the sentence. For example, “The apple was eaten by John” or just “The apple was eaten”. Only sentences that contain direct objects can be constructed in the passive voice. Thus, “John ate” cannot be constructed passively.

In situations where either voice will work, generally choose the active voice for more directness. However, sometimes the passive voice makes for a more natural tone in certain use cases. For example, if the true subject of the sentence is a system, and the human is secondary, passive voice can be acceptable.
