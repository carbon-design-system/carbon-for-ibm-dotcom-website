## Content foundations

The following are guidelines on how to create effective content. For starters, here are some of the most common rules:

- Keep sentences as short and simple as possible – typically 25 or fewer words.
- If it doesn’t impact meaning, use a shorter or more common word instead of a longer or more technical word (e.g.:
  “use” instead of “utilize”).
- Avoid slang, jargon, sarcasm, emoticons and country (or regional) colloquialisms.
- Be succinct and avoid redundant and unnecessary text.
- In general, use a complete sentence to introduce a list. Introduce procedures with a sentence, an infinitive phrase,
  or a heading.

While you’ll find the most common content guidelines here, refer to these two sources for more in-depth information:

  </a>{' '}

## Voice and tone

When crafting content for IBM.com website pages, the content tone should sound like you are speaking to a respected
professional acquaintance, using clear language and short declarative sentences. Text should educate or persuade
readers, not dazzle them with verbal acrobatics. A casual and conversational tone is acceptable and appropriate; overly
informal language, slang, jargon, and disparaging or heavily opinionated comments are not.

In general, the writing style should always be simple, clear, and easy to understand. Using everyday language keeps the
tone friendly, human, and inviting. Choose short words over long impressive-sounding words.

## Writing for accessibility

Accessibility is the successful access to information and use of information technology by people who have disabilities.
Content for IBM.com website pages must be accessible.

Here are a few best practices for accessibility:

- Avoid complex language, auto-playing animations and videos, and flashing animations.
- Designs should pass usability heuristics, such as cognitive walkthroughs, to ensure users do not feel overloaded when
  completing tasks.
- Ask yourself whether the visual information translated effectively into text. Can an image be understood through its
  metadata alone?

For detailed guidance about writing for all users, please read the
<a href="https://www.ibm.com/able/toolkit/design/content/text-equivalents/" target="_blank">Content design section</a>
of the IBM Accessibility site and the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/" target="_blank">Web
Content Accessibility guidelines</a>.

## Specific style guidelines

### Capitalization

**Use sentence-case capitalization for all UI text elements.** This style is predominantly lowercase. Capitalize only
the initial letter of the first word in the text and other words that require capitalization, such as proper nouns. For
example, labels in a table would be written as “First name” and “Email address”. Unless the name is a product or service
name, or is trademarked, always use sentence-style capitalization.

**Do not use title case capitalization.** Title (or headline) case capitalization is where the first letter of most
words is capitalized, but not articles, conjunctions, or prepositions (except if any of these are the first or last word
in the sentence or phrase). Instead, use sentence-case capitalization.

**Do not use all caps capitalization.** All caps (or uppercase) capitalization is where every letter is capitalized.

#### Please use capital letters for:
- “IBM” or any other company or organization name
- Any official, trademarked product or service (whether from IBM or not) – unless they intentionally use a lowercase
  letter at the beginning, such as the iPhone
- Any initialisms (for example, BBC, HTML) or acronyms (for example, NASA, NATO)
- Any people
- Any country or place names
- Referring to any UI labels that are themselves capitalized
- When the word begins a sentence or phrase

If it’s not in the list above, it should not be capitalized. Capitalize proper nouns, such as the names of people,
places, and products are proper nouns and therefore all take initial capitals.

### Inclusive language

IBM is committed to eliminating language that supports racial, cultural, or gender bias. It is critical that all words used in any capacity in product offerings be inclusive in their language.

IBMers who are unsure about a particular word can search the <a href="http://ibm.biz/termsearch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IBM Terminology database</a>, and can also <a href="http://tlwi.w3-969.ibm.com/standards/terminology/feedbackform2.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">submit a term for review</a>.

For more information about this important work, see the <a href="https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/inclusive-it-terminology/take-action" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Inclusive IT Terminology</a> site.

### Pronouns

In general, use the second person (you, your) as often as possible.

Use the first person in headings or labels that are very specific to the user or customer data, for example “My account”
or “My usage.” However, in explanatory text for the heading or label, switch to second person. For example, “Your usage
is calculated from the first day of the month.”

Where appropriate, use first person (we, our) to refer to IBM. For example, in requests for personal information, such
as name and email address, where the user will benefit from knowing why IBM is asking for this information. Example:
“Why do we need your email address?”

Avoid third-person pronouns that are gender specific.

For more detailed guidance about pronouns, refer to the
<a href="https://www-03preprod.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/ibm_style/pronouns.html" target="_blank">Pronouns</a>
topic in IBM Style.

### Active and passive voice

The active voice is direct and emphasizes the subject of the sentence. For example, “John ate the apple”.

The passive voice, on the other hand, flips the construction so that the subject is secondary to the verb and object.
Often, the subject is not even included in the sentence. For example, “The apple was eaten by John” or just “The apple
was eaten”. Only sentences that contain direct objects can be constructed in the passive voice. Thus, “John ate” cannot
be constructed passively.

In situations where either voice will work, generally choose the active voice for more directness. However, sometimes
the passive voice makes for a more natural tone in certain use cases. For example, if the true subject of the sentence
is a system, and the human is secondary, passive voice can be acceptable.

## Character count standard

### Character count sizes

The following character count sizes should be used for all compnents and patterns when setting text content. This is the

| Name  | Size (English) | Size (translated) |
| :---- | :------------- | :---------------- |
| Micro | 20             | 32                |
| Mini  | 25             | 35                |
| XXS   | 40             | 55                |
| XS    | 65             | 85                |
| S     | 75             | 100               |
| M     | 120            | 150               |
| L     | 150            | 200               |
| LL    | 200            | 260               |
| XL    | 250            | 325               |
| XXL   | 350            | 450               |

### Translation conversion table

The following table provides a good indication of the amount of additional space needed to contain a text passage after
translation. This is the official statement about string length calculation for translations, according to Rule A3 in
<a target="_blank" href="http://w3-03.ibm.com/globalization/page/4619">IBM Globalization Design Guide</a>.

The numbers represent statistical averages. In some situations they will be overly generous, while in others the
translator will have difficulty fitting in all the translated words. Ideally the translator can use any amount of space,
but use the following list as a rough guide to the space that should be left for MRI expansion:

| Number of characters in text | Additional physical space required |
| :--------------------------- | :--------------------------------- |
| Up to 10                     | 100% to 200%                       |
| 11 to 20                     | 80% to 100%                        |
| 21 to 30                     | 60% to 80%                         |
| 31 to 50                     | 40% to 60%                         |
| 51 to 70                     | 31% to 40%                         |
| Over 70                      | 30%                                |
