The primary user intent drives the foundational structure of any given page defined as part of the associated style model. This ensures consistency. These are the known user intents and associated style models for IBM.com pages.

## User intents and style models

These user intents and style models are not set in stoneâ€”they and are intended to evolve over time. If for any reason, the existing user intents or style models do not meet the user needs, please contact the Digital Design System team via the <a href="https://cognitive-app.slack.com/archives/C2PLX8GQ6" target="_blank">#ibm-digital-design</a> slack channel.
