Typography can help create clear hierarchies, organize information, and guide users through a product or experience. Type-parings are the key to making the best IBM.com experiences through typography successfully. 

Type-paring supports different levels of architecture or areas that require varying typographic hierarchies.

## Type pairing

It's essential to understand the typeface, type scale, type tokens, and the Expressive type sets before dive into creating an IBM.com website page. Make sure you visit the sections following to learn more about them.

Below are some known type parings when designing for IBM.com with the standard spacing set up to ensure you create clear hierarchies, proper information organization, and the best experience to guide users through the IBM.com experience. If for any reason, the existing pairings do not meet your needs, please contact the Digital Design System team via the [#carbon-for-ibm-dotcom slack channel](https://cognitive-app.slack.com/archives/C2PLX8GQ6).

## Typeface

Carbon for IBM.com uses the open-source typeface [IBM Plex](https://www.ibm.com/plex/). It has been carefully designed to meet IBM's needs as a global technology company and reflect IBM's spirit, beliefs, and design principles. IBM Plex can be accessed and downloaded from the [Plex GitHub Repo](https://github.com/ibm/plex).

<br />

## Type scale

Carbon for IBM uses the [IBM type scale](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/typography/overview/#scale), which is built on a single equation. The formula for our scale was created to provide a hierarchy for all types of experiences. The procedure assumes that yâ‚€=12 px:
<TypeScaleTable />

```
Xn = Xn-1 + {INT[(n-2)/4] + 1} * 2
Xn: step n type size Xn-1: step n-1 type size
```
<br />

## Type tokens

Carbon for IBM.com uses type tokens and themes to manage typography. Type tokens are pre-set configurations of typographic elements such as font size, weight, or leading (line-height) that are precisely calibrated for use alongside IBM Plex in the IBM.com experience.
<br />

## Expressive type sets

Expressive type is reserved for use in editorial and digital marketing experiences across all IBM.com website pages. Productive type is reserved for use in web-based product design, where the user needs to focus on tasks.

Expressive type sets require more dynamic typographic hierarchies and more variety in the Heading scale, and that's the main difference between the two. Make sure you learn more about the [Expressive type sets](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/typography/expressive) on the Carbon website before start creating.
