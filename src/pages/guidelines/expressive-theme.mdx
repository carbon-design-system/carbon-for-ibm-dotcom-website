The Expressive theme is a flavor of the Carbon Design System that was created for the reading and learning experiences common on IBM.com.

<InlineNotification kind="warning">

**Note:** The Expressive Theme has been integrated into Carbon Design System’s core library. This means that expressive continues to be available to IBM.com, but now all Carbon adopters can get both productive and expressive experiences from the same library source. This change will be seamless for current adopters of Carbon for IBM.com. In the next few sprints, we will be shifting to use expressive styling and elements from core, after which the Expressive Theme within Carbon for IBM.com will no longer be maintained. <a href="help/expressive-update">Learn more about this change</a>

## Expressive theme fundamentals
Carbon was originally designed and developed for product centric experiences where the ability to display dense information and content was crucial.

Based on various research regarding users and cognitive science, it was determined that IBM.com needed a slightly larger type scale for all device form factors for the web with a focus on longer reading experiences.

### Type scale

The Expressive theme increases Carbon Design System’s base type size of 14px to 16px and systematically increased the other type sizes within the system.

The base type size is increasing from 14px to 16px.


| Type token | Carbon default scale (size/line-height) | Carbon Expressive scale (size/line-height) |
|:---|:---|:---|
|`$code-01`|12px / 16px|14px / 20px|
|`$code-02`|14px / 20px|16px / 24px|
|`$caption-01`|12px / 16px|14px / 18px|
|`$label-01`|12px / 16px|14px / 18px|
|`$helper-text-01`|12px / 16px|14px / 18px|
|`$body-short-01`|14px / 18px|16px / 22px|
|`$body-long-01`|14px / 20px|16px / 24px|
|`productive-heading-01`|14px / 18px|16px / 22px|


### Icons

To match the increased type size, the standard 16px by 16px icon size for Carbon's 14px base type has increased to 20px by 20px for the 16px base type in the Expressive theme.

### Containers

Container sizes were increased systematically to accommodate the larger type sizes. The default container size for most components increased from 40px to 48px.

## Expressive theme and Carbon for IBM.com

By default, the Expressive theme is enabled in Carbon for IBM.com (starting in `v1.10.0`). This is to guarantee consistency across
all IBM.com experiences. However, the Expressive theme is also available as its own offering within the Carbon for IBM.com
styles package (available in `v1.9.0`). Read more about how to implement within any non-IBM.com applications at
