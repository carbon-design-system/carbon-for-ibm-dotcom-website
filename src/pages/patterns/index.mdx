In the Digital Design System, patterns comprise common user flows and scenarios which are too complex or too universal to be encapsulated in a single component. Individual patterns often include two or more components from the system or apply to multiple components independently. 
 
The patterns library is constantly growing, and the Digital Design core team encourages contributions of UX patterns which can apply to a broad set of Digital Design System adopters.

## Types

| Expressive patterns                            |                                                                                                              |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [Cards](/patterns/cards)     | Cards are a highly flexible component for displaying a wide variety of content, including informational, getting started, how-to, next steps, and other types of content. Digital Design ships basic cards structure that responds to the grid.  |
| [Leadspace](/patterns/leadspace)   | Leadspace is the first full-width section below the masthead and is optional. Leadspaces typically include a stylized background, headline, and a call to action (CTA). This section engages visitors to sign up, submit information, search for, or purchase something.                                       |
| [Page layout](/patterns/page-layout)               | Page layout is create by using a simple grid system and simple layouts derived from it, user experience can be vastly improved through lighter experience & content, and stronger consistency through the user’s journey.                       |
