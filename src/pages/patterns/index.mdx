<PageDescription>

In Carbon for IBM.com, layout patterns comprise common user flows and scenarios which are too complex or too universal to be encapsulated in a single component. Individual layout patterns often include two or more components from the system or apply to multiple components independently. 
 
The layout patterns library is constantly growing, and the Carbon for IBM.com core team encourages contributions of UX layout patterns which can apply to a broad set of Carbon for IBM.com adopters.
