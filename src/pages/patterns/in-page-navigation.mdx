<PageDescription>

In-page navigation is used to deliberately move users through a narrative in a logical manner. It also allows users to choose their own journey of discovery by providing non-linear modes of navigation within a single page. It is an effective way to guide users through long-form reading or complex experiences.

## Overview

In-page navigation permits a user to skip to or reveal content that is located on a single page at any point, without leaving that page.
In-page navigation can take a user in any direction as long as they remain in the same context or environment. In addition to the typical navigation modes of scrolling and tabbing, these patterns provide others ways in which users can discover content on a page.

## Jump to section

Users may need to leapfrog between content sections on a page. Shortcuts should be made available to users so that they can discover content at a pace that suits them, especially on pages that require significant scrolling.

Examples of design devices that allow users to jump to section:

<Title>Table of contents</Title>

![Table of contents](../../images/pattern/in-page-nav/in-page-nav-toc.jpg)

<Caption>
  A table of contents (TOC) allows a user to jump to a section title at any
  point in time while on the page.
</Caption>

<Title>Card link</Title>

![Card link](../../images/pattern/in-page-nav/in-page-nav-cardlink.jpg)

<Caption>
  A single card can be used to jump users to associated content located further
  down the page.
</Caption>

<Title>Anchor link</Title>

<Caption>
  An anchor link also allows users to jump to a specific point on the page.

### When to use jump to section

- Use to give navigational control to users
- Use to save users’ need to scroll and time to read
- Use on pages that have many content sections

### When not to use jump to section

- Do not use if the order of content is crucial to the user
- Do not use when you want the user to focus on the narrative
- Do not use when there is no need to highlight specific points of interest

## Hide and Reveal

When designing with a great deal of content, separating data into modules, sub-sections or sub-pages – while simultaneously allowing users to access it from the same view – can be an effective way to use space and keep users’ attention.

Examples of ways to provide hide and reveal functionality:

<Title>Tabs</Title>

![Tabs](../../images/pattern/in-page-nav/in-page-nav-tabs.jpg)

<Caption>
  In this example,{' '}
  <a
    href="https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/tabs/usage"
    target="_blank"
  >
    tabs
  </a>{' '}
  are used to separate content into bitesized chunks. Users can navigate
  horizontally to reveal each one.
</Caption>

<Title>Carousel</Title>

![Carousel](../../images/pattern/in-page-nav/in-page-nav-carousel.jpg)

<Caption>
  A carousel component allows the user to browse through multiple pieces of
  content within the same area of a page.
</Caption>

### When to use hide and reveal

- Use when there are 3–9 sections of content that require a flat navigation mode
- Use when there is limited space available for vertical stacking
- Use when each content item has the same hierarchy

### When not to use hide and reveal

- Do not use when the content would be better suited to a full page
- Do not use when there is ample space on the page
- Do not use to hide important information

## Back-to-top

When users reach the bottom of a long page, they often will need to get back to the top to access the main navigation menu, interact with the filter and sort features, or re-read interesting content that is located near the top of the page.

_Design examples coming soon._

### When to use back-to-top

- Use on long pages that require a lot of scrolling
- Use when the global navigation is not visible to the user at all times
- Use when filters, search and sort features are located at the top of the page

### When not to use back-to-top

- Do not use on short pages where scrolling is not a burden
- Do not use when there is an interactive table of contents
- Do not use more than one back-to-top button on a single page
