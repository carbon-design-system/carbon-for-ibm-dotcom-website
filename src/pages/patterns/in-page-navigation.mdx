<PageDescription>

In-page navigation can be used to intentionally move users through a narrative in a logical manner or allow them to choose their own journey. 
It is an effective way to guide users through long-form reading or complex experiences.

## Overview
In-page navigation allows a user to skip to or reveal associated content at any point, without leaving the page. 
In-page navigation can take a user in any direction as long as they remain in the same context or environment.


## Jump to section

Users may need to leapfrog between content sections on a page. Shortcuts should be made available to users so that they can discover content at a pace that suits them, especially on pages that require significant scrolling. 

Examples of components that allow users to jump to section:

<Title>Table of contents</Title>
![Table of contents](../../images/pattern/in-pagenav/in-page-nav-toc.jpg)

<Caption>
A table of contents (TOC) allows a user to jump to a section title at any point in time while on the page.
</Caption>


<Title>Card link</Title>

<Caption>
A single card can be used to jump users to associated content located further down the page.
</Caption>

<Title>Anchor link</Title>

An anchor link also allows users to jump to a specific point on the page.

### When to use jump to section

* Use to give navigational control to users 
* Use to save users’ need to scroll and time to read
* Use on pages that have many content sections

### When not to use jump to section

* Do not use if the order of content is crucial to the user
* Do not use when you want the user to focus on the narrative
* Do not use when there is no need to highlight specific points of interest


## Hide and Reveal

When designing with a great deal of content, separating data into modules, sub-sections or sub-pages – while simultaneously allowing users to access it from the same view – can be an effective way to use space and keep users’ attention. 

Examples of components that provide hide and reveal functionality:

<Title>Tabs</Title>
![Tabs](../../images/pattern/in-pagenav/in-page-nav-tabs.jpg)

<Caption>
In this example, tabs are used to separate content into bitesized chunks. Users can navigate horizontally to reveal each one.

<Title>Carousel</Title>

<Caption>
A carousel component allows the user to browse through multiple pieces of content within the same area of a page.
</Caption>

### When to use hide and reveal

* Use when there are 3–9 sections of content that require a flat navigation mode 
* Use when there is limited space available for vertical stacking
* Use when each content item has the same hierarchy 

### When not to use hide and reveal

* Do not use when the content would be better suited to a full page
* Do not use when there is ample space on the page
* Do not use to hide important information


## Back-to-top

When users reach the bottom of a long page, they often will need to get back to the top to access the main navigation menu, interact with the filter and sort features, or re-read interesting content that is located near the top of the page.

_Design examples coming soon._

### When to use back-to-top

* Use on long pages that require a lot of scrolling 
* Use when the global navigation is not visible to the user at all times
* Use when filters, search and sort features are located at the top of the page 

### When not to use back-to-top

* Do not use on short pages where scrolling is not a burden
* Do not use when there is an interactive table of contents
* Do not use more than one back-to-top button on a single page
