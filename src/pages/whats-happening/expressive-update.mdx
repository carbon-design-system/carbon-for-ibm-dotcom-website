We're excited to say the Expressive theme mission is now complete and the theme has been integrated into Carbon Design System's core library. 

Read on to see what this means for teams using the Carbon for IBM.com library.

## Background

Two years ago, Carbon Expressive Theme was introduced as a wrapper within the Carbon for IBM.com library, quietly bumping up type sizes and container heights when needed.

The goal was to bridge the gap so IBM.com page makers could deliver an expressive digital experience while still being compliant with Carbon.

## Recent work

The Carbon for IBM.com and Carbon teams have been working to consolidate foundational assets into the core design system library that now includes both expressive and productive type sizes. We removed the expressive wrapper in v1.25.0 (27 Sep 2021), after expressive sizes were integrated into Carbon Design System’s core library.

Having everything in one place makes it easier to both maintain and use the assets, especially as teams begin to extend their designs to include both productive and expressive styling.

## What’s changed

#### Button, Link, and List 

While the Expressive theme adjusted all components of the Carbon Design System, DDS and Carbon decided to simplify the expressive options to only those components essential to long form reading and call-to-actions: Button, Link, and List.

These three core components have been available as expressive variants in the Carbon repo since Carbon v10.35 and will be available in the Carbon Sketch kit from v11 forward. 

Also, these components along with other key components from the library, will be available this quarter in the new Carbon for IBM.com design kits. 

#### New type tokens

We also added additional type tokens to pair with the larger type styles used in expressive experiences:

| Text usage    | Productive token    | Expressive token (new) |
| ------------- | ------------------- | ------------------ |
| Caption       | `$caption-01`         | `$caption-02`        |
| Label         | `$label-01`           | `$label-02`          |
| Helper text   | `$helper-text-01`     | `$helper-text-02`    |

## Next steps

### What does this mean for designers?

#### New Carbon for IBM.com design kits

We’ve been working on new design kits in both Figma and Sketch! 

We’re releasing the kits iteratively and the first versions are available below. They include color tokens, and expressive and productive type styles. We’ll be adding key components from the Carbon for IBM.com library over time. 

The Sketch kit is available in each of the themes.

We are also alpha testing a Figma kit. It currently contains type styles and all color tokens in the one kit. We are exploring creating separate kits for each theme so things may change but the alpha kit is great if you want to dive in and get started with Figma. Stay tuned for updates!

#### The Carbon Expressive Sketch kit 
The Carbon Expressive Sketch kit is no longer being maintained. We are shifting focus to our new kits, adding components unique to IBM.com, and making these design assets available for adopters as soon as possible.

#### Designing expressive experiences 

We have new and detailed guidance on how to design an expressive experience for IBM.com, see [Expressive styling](../../guidelines/expressive-styling/overview) to learn all about styling strategies and type pairings.

### What does this mean for developers?

The Expressive theme was managed within Carbon for IBM.com so this change has been delivered to your applications transparently. Unless you manually included the Expressive theme, no work is necessary on your part.

Any customized components will need to be reviewed. If you're not ready to accept the changes immediately, wait for your designers to review the impact.

The Expressive theme is part of the styles package. It's still available but will no longer be maintained.

In the past we have automatically turned on the Expressive theme when including the masthead and footer on the page, and this will no longer be the case starting v1.25.
