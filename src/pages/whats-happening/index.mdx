### FAQ

#### What is the Carbon for IBM.com v2 beta and when will it be ready?

Beta version of v2 is planned for end of June 2023. This will be the first pre-release version of the library. It will be the first opportunity for adopters/users to work with the package and provide feedback to the team regarding any bugs or differences that weren’t expected. See Long Term Support (LTS) for the timeline above.

#### When are we launching Carbon for IBM.com v2 production?

Production release is planned for end of September 2023. This will be when the package is considered General Availability (GA). See Long Term Support (LTS) for the timeline above.

#### What is required for migration?

We are working on migration guidance as we build out the v2 package. More resources and links will be provided here, so check back for more details.

#### When do adopters have to migrate?

Adopters should plan to migrate their application, webpages, and/or docs to Carbon for IBM.com v2 _before the end of maintenance of v1_. Ensure you have built the time for migration into your planning for 2024. If you remain on v1 after the end of maintenance, your application could have a risk with unresolved security vulnerabilities and/or outdated upstream dependencies. See Long Term Support (LTS) for the timeline above.

#### What frameworks will be supported?

Carbon for IBM.com v2 will no longer support React and focus fully on web components. This applies to the [@carbon/web-components](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-for-ibm-dotcom/tree/main/packages/carbon-web-components) and [@carbon/ibmdotcom-web-components](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-for-ibm-dotcom/tree/main/packages/web-components) packages. Both packages will still provide React wrappers for projects requiring React.

- Carbon for IBM.com Web Components
- Carbon for IBM.com Web Components with React wrappers
- Carbon Web Components v2

#### Will Carbon for IBM.com React v1 be deprecated?

Yes, all teams that rely on the Carbon for IBM.com React package can migrate to the React wrappers.
