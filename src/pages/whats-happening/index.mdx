## FAQ

#### When will Carbon for IBM.com v2 be ready for production?

Carbon for IBM.com was release on December 11, 2023 and is ready to be used in production environments!

#### What is required for migration?

We have done our best to minimize migration efforts for our adopters. Please see our [migration docs](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-for-ibm-dotcom/blob/release/v2.0.0/docs/dotcom-v2-migration.md) for more details.

#### When do adopters have to migrate?

Adopters should plan to migrate their application, webpages, and/or docs to Carbon for IBM.com v2 _before the end of maintenance of v1_. Ensure you have built the time for migration into your planning for 2024. If you remain on v1 after the end of maintenance, your application could have a risk with unresolved security vulnerabilities and/or outdated upstream dependencies. See the Long-term Support timeline above.

#### What frameworks will be supported?

Carbon for IBM.com v2 will no longer support React and focus fully on web components. This applies to the [@carbon/web-components](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-for-ibm-dotcom/tree/main/packages/carbon-web-components) and [@carbon/ibmdotcom-web-components](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-for-ibm-dotcom/tree/main/packages/web-components) packages. Both packages will still provide React wrappers for projects requiring React.
