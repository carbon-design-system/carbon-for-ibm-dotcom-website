## Check for compliance

Audits are run page by page. To run an audit, enter the page URL below and click `Analyze page`.

<BeaconWebUI url="https://www.ibm.com" />

## What’s included

The audits provide actionable results including:

- Components and common areas that are causing problems for adopters, such as Leadspace, CTA Section, Cards, Content Block, and Content Section.
- Design system usage and versions, including earlier IBM versions and external design systems.
- Page data analysis, including localization issues and package version checks.
- Unauthorized or unapproved services or components in use.
- Legal compliance in footer content.
- Carbon Design System compliance, checking for correct color and type tokens.

The tool is in beta but is ready to use and the Carbon for IBM.com team will be adding more compliance audits over time. If there’s anything you’d like to see included, [let us know on Slack](https://cognitive-app.slack.com/archives/C2PLX8GQ6).

## What’s not included

The tool is designed to be used for IBM.com sites only with a focus on compliance with IBM standards. It does not perform accessibility or SEO checks.

If you’re looking for general web audits, use Google Lighthouse, which is available as an [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lighthouse) and built-in Chrome extension.
