<PageDescription>

IBM.com is a place for people to learn about, try, and buy IBM products and services. Visitors to IBM.com deserve to have an efficient and delightful experience while on their journey.

</PageDescription>

<PageDescription>

Towards that end, Carbon for IBM.com has been built with the goal of providing efficiency and consistency across IBM.com using IBM Design Language (IDL) principles and based on the Carbon Design System (Carbon).  

This site is intended to provide guidance and resources for designers and developers who create sites and/or applications on IBM.com and other IBM domains.

**Note:** Carbon for IBM.com is the strategic design system for IBM web experiences.  Any application using older systems like Northstar (v18), v19, or even earlier versions should make plans to adopt Carbon for ibm.com by the end of 2021.  After all applications have migrated, plans and dates will be announced for sunsetting the older systems.  Reach out to us in our IBM slack channel at [#carbon-for-ibm-dotcom](https://ibm-studios.slack.com/archives/C2PLX8GQ6) with any questions.

## The latest update

**The Expressive Theme has been integrated into Carbon Design System's core library.** <br />
What does this mean for teams using Carbon for IBM.com?  It simply means that expressive continues to be available to IBM.com, but now all Carbon adopters can get both productive and expressive experiences from the same [design kit source](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/designing/kits/sketch/).


## What is included in Carbon for IBM.com?

Carbon for IBM.com is focused on supporting IBM.com applications and websites. It provides features and components relevant to IBM.com.

* Components usage and code (e.g. Masthead and Footer)
* Layout patterns usage and code (e.g. Lead Space and Table of Contents)
* Services and utilities (e.g. required Tealium)
* Implementation guidelines 
* Design and functional spec files
* Links to sandbox and code resources
* Metrics
* Accessibility tested and compliant
* Optimized code

## How to decide the right path for adoption

### For pages produced and published in Marketing's Content Management System, please note the following:
Carbon will be made available through the creation of pages in AEM. The use of these templates when they become available is the path to Carbon because these templates are part of a new content model and publishing tool. 

For more information, please visit internal link [Afterburner](https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/adobe).

In the interim, while these templates are being built, page owners can use the Design Guidelines to configure existing pages to have the look and feel of IBM Design Language. 

For more information, please visit [Marketing Platforms Drupal CMS website](https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/squad-pulse/marketing-platforms/drupal-cms#Links).


### For websites or applications on v18 (Northstar), v19a, or other design systems, make plans now to migrate your site to Carbon for IBM.com
This site explains how to get started with Carbon for IBM.com. It provides links to the code repository, the storybook, usage guidelines, and additional resources for getting started. Keep in mind the following things as you get started:

* Carbon and Carbon for IBM.com is built using Node Package Manager (NPM), not the Content Delivery Network (CDN), so it requires a development rewrite, unlike prior design systems.
* Carbon has a new 2x grid so everything needs to be designed understanding that grid.
* This platform is open source, so any adopters are invited to contribute to the open source Carbon for IBM.com.

To assist adopters through this transition, Digital Design Squad (DDS) can guide you as you are getting started. Reach out on our IBM slack channel at [#carbon-for-ibm-dotcom](https://ibm-studios.slack.com/archives/C2PLX8GQ6).
