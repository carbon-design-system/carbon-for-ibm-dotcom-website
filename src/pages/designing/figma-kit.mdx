## Accessing the new Figma kit

<Row>
<Column  colLg={8} colMd={8} colSm={4}>

We have a new Figma kit for delivering Carbon for IBM.com components. The kit contains libraries for each theme and includes color tokens, expressive and productive type styles, components, and grid templates.

We’ll be adding more components over time, and Figma will notify you when library updates are available.

Once you are in the IBM organization, you will automatically have access to the Carbon for IBM.com Figma libraries.

### Adding the libraries to your file

Unlike Sketch, Figma does not need time to "install" or "download" a library file before you can start using them. The libraries are added to a project instantly when you flip a toggle. Be sure to login to Figma using SSO and your IBM ID. This will ensure you are in the IBM organization and have access to all of our libraries.

#### To add one or all of the themes in your design:

1. In the menu, click the Figma dropdown then select `Libraries`. Alternatively, click the `Asset` panel, and then the open book, or `Library` icon.
2. In the Libraries list, search for `Carbon for IBM.com`.
3. Select the theme to enable.

### Figma tutorials

If you are new to Figma, they offer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Figmadesign/playlists?view=50&sort=dd&shelf_id=3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video tutorials</a> on their official YouTube channel.

## Using the Figma kit

Our Figma resources are set up to help you design using key IBM assets. Learn more about using the [2x Grid](#2x-grid), [Components](#components), [Text styles](#text-styles), and [Color styles](#color-styles) in Figma.

### 2x Grid

The IBM 2x Grid is the framework for laying out all visual elements.

#### Understanding the grid

For a detailed walkthrough of the 2x Grid, see the foundational 2x Grid guidance on the Carbon Design System site. The [Overview](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/2x-grid/overview) provides the background and design rationale for the 2x Grid. [Implementation](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/2x-grid/implementation) will get you up and running, designing with the grid.

For information about using the 2x Grid with web pages, including best practices, see our [Layout guidelines](../guidelines/layout).

#### Start using the grid

#### To apply the grid template to a frame in Figma:

1. Select the frame.
2. In `Design panel → Layout Grid`, click `Style`.
3. Choose your breakpoint to display the grid.

You can click the eye icon to hide or show the grid.

### Components

Carbon for IBM.com components are available in the design kit.

#### To bring components into your file:

1. In the Layers panel, select `Layers → Assets`.
2. Choose one of the Carbon for IBM.com themes.
3. Select a component and drag it onto the canvas. Alternatively, search for the component by name.

</Column>

#### Component variants

Some components contain variants that allow you to change properties such as breakpoint, type, and interactive state. If a component contains variants, you will see them in the `Design` panel when you select a component. Before making updates directly to a component, check to see if the option is available as a variant.

#### Description and documentation

Some components will contain additional guidance and links to documentation. When selecting a component, check the `Design` panel for a description and link to any relevant documentation.

### Text styles

Carbon for IBM.com text styles are available in each library.

#### To apply text styles to text:

1. Select the text to change.
2. In the `Design panel → Text`, click `Style`.
3. Select the text style to apply. Hover for additional usage guidance.

Text styles within components are carefully considered. It’s important that you do not detach the symbol to change default styles.

### Color styles

Carbon for IBM.com color styles are available in each library.

#### To apply color styles to an element:

1. Select the text to change.
2. In the `Design panel → Fill`, click `Style`.
3. Select the text style to apply. Hover for additional usage guidance.

### Other Figma resources

#### Bring in colors

For full IBM brand palette colors, open the `Libraries` overlay in Figma, select or search for “Color Styles - IBM Design Language”.

#### Bring in icons and pictograms

Icons and pictograms live in the IBM Design Language libraries. In the `Libraries` overlay in Figma, select or search for “Icons and Pictograms - IBM Design Language”.
