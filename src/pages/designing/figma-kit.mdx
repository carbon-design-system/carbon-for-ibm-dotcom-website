## Install the alpha Figma kit

We are alpha testing a Figma kit that contains type styles and all color tokens
in the one kit. We are currently working on creating separate kits for each
theme so things may change but the alpha kit is great if you want to dive in and
get started with Figma. Stay tuned for updates!
