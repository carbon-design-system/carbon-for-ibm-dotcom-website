The Carbon for IBM.com team is alpha testing a Figma kit that contains type
styles and all color tokens in the one kit.

We are currently working on creating separate kits for each theme so things may
change but the alpha kit is great if you want to dive in and get started with
Figma. Stay tuned for updates!
