## Accessing the new Figma kit

<Row>
<Column  colLg={8} colMd={8} colSm={4}>

We have a new Figma kit for delivering pre-built versions of the Carbon for IBM.com components. The kit contains libraries for each theme and includes color tokens, expressive and productive type styles, components, and grid templates.

We’ll update the kit with more components and adjustment to existing components over time, and Figma will notify you when library updates are available.

If you are in the IBM organization in Figma, you will automatically have access to the Carbon for IBM.com Figma libraries.

### Activating the new Figma kit

If you are in the IBM Figma organization, you can access the Carbon for IBM.com Figma kits via your Figma file.

#### To use one or all of the themes in your Figma file:

1. In the menu, click the Figma dropdown then select `Libraries`.
2. In the Libraries list, search for `Carbon for IBM.com`.
3. Select the theme to enable.

### Figma tutorials

If you are new to Figma, they offer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Figmadesign/playlists?view=50&sort=dd&shelf_id=3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video tutorials</a> on their official YouTube channel.

## Using the Figma kit

Our Figma resources are set up to help you design using key IBM assets. Learn more about using the [2x Grid](#2x-grid), [Components](#components), [Text styles](#text-styles), and [Color styles](#color-styles) in Figma.

### 2x Grid

The IBM 2x Grid is the framework for laying out all visual elements.

#### Understanding the grid

For a detailed walkthrough of the 2x Grid, see the foundational 2x Grid guidance on the Carbon Design System site. The [Overview](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/2x-grid/overview) provides the background and design rationale for the 2x Grid. [Implementation](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/2x-grid/implementation) will get you up and running, designing with the grid.

For information about using the 2x Grid with web pages, including best practices, see our [Layout guidelines](../guidelines/layout).

#### Start using the grid

In Figma, frames function as artboards and containers for everything from screens to buttons. You can learn more about frames in Figma’s <a href="https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041539473-Frames-in-Figma" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">documentation</a>. You can apply the grid template to a frame in Figma if you have one or more of the Carbon for IBM.com libraries active:

#### To apply the grid template to a frame in Figma:

1. Have one or more of the Carbon for IBM.com libraries active.
2. Select the frame to apply the template to.
3. In `Design panel → Layout Grid`, click `Style`.
4. Choose your breakpoint to display the grid.

You can click the eye icon to hide or show the grid.

### Components

Carbon for IBM.com components are available in the design kit.

#### To bring components into your file:

1. Have one or more of the Carbon for IBM.com libraries active.
2. In the Layers panel, select `Layers → Assets`.
3. Choose one of the Carbon for IBM.com themes.
4. Select a component and drag it onto the canvas.

#### Component variants

Some components contain variants that allow you to change the properties of a component such as breakpoint, type, and interactive state. If a component contains variants, you will see them in the Design panel when you select a component. Before making updates directly to a component, check to see if the option is available as a variant.

<Caption>Component variants are accessed in the Design panel</Caption>

#### Description and documentation

Some components will contain additional guidance and links to documentation. When selecting a component, check the Design panel for a description and link to any relevant documentation.

### Text styles

Carbon for IBM.com text styles are available in each library.

#### To apply text styles to text:

1. Have one or more of the Figma libraries active.
2. Select the text to change.
3. In the `Design panel → Text`, click on `Style`.
4. Select the text style to apply. Hover for additional usage guidance.

Text styles within components are carefully considered. It’s important that you do not detach the symbol to change default styles.

### Color styles

Carbon for IBM.com color styles are available in each library.

#### To apply color styles to an element:

1. Have one or more of the Figma libraries active.
2. Select the text to change.
3. In the `Design panel → Fill`, click on `Style`.
4. Select the text style to apply. Hover for additional usage guidance.

### Other Figma resources

#### Bring in colors

Additional color collections live in the IBM Design Systems libraries. In the Libraries overlay in Figma, select or search for “Color Styles - IBM Design Language”.

#### Bring in icons and pictograms

Icons and pictograms live in the IBM Design Systems libraries. In the Libraries overlay in Figma, select or search for “Icons and Pictograms - IBM Design Language”.
