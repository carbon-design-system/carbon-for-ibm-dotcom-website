## Accessing the new Figma kit

<Row>

We have a new Figma kit for delivering pre-built versions of the Carbon for IBM.com components. The kit contains libraries for each theme and includes color tokens, expressive and productive type styles, components, and grid templates.

We’ll update the kit with more components and adjustment to existing components over time, and Figma will notify you when library updates are available.

If you are in the IBM organization in Figma, you will automatically have access to the Carbon for IBM.com Figma libraries.

### Accessing the new Figma kit

If you are in the IBM Figma organization, you can access the Carbon for IBM.com Figma kits via your Figma file.

#### To use one or all of the themes in your Figma file:

1. In the menu, click the Figma dropdown then select **Libraries**.
2. In the Libraries list, search for **Carbon for IBM.com**.
3. Select the theme to enable.

### Figma tutorials

If you are new to Figma, they offer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Figmadesign/playlists?view=50&sort=dd&shelf_id=3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video tutorials on their official YouTube channel</a>.

## Using the Figma kit

Our Sketch resources are set up to help you design using key IBM assets. Learn more about using the 2x Grid, Components, Text styles, and Color styles in Figma.

### 2x Grid

The IBM 2x Grid is the framework for laying out all visual elements.

#### Understanding the grid

For a detailed walkthrough of the 2x Grid, see the foundational 2x Grid guidance on the Carbon Design System site. The Overview provides the background and design rationale for the 2x Grid. Implementation will get you up and running, designing with the grid.

For information about using the 2x Grid with web pages, including best practices, see our Layout guidelines.

#### Start using the grid

In Figma, frames act as artboards and containers for everything from screens to buttons. You can learn more about frames in Figma’s documentation. You can apply the grid template to a frame in Figma if you have one or more of the Carbon for IBM.com libraries active:

1. Create a frame at one of the breakpoints.
2. Select the frame you wish to apply the grid template to.
3. In the Design panel, hover over “Layout grid” and click the four dot icon that appears.
4. Click on the grid layout you wish to apply, and/or click on the 8px grid.

To toggle the grid on and off, select the frame and look under the Design panel for the applied grid template. Hover over the grid template and click the eye icon to hide the grid template.

### Components

Carbon for IBM.com components are available in the design kit. You can start bringing in components if you have one or more of the Carbon for IBM.com libraries active:

1. On the left-hand side of the UI, select Assets in the Layers panel.
2. Inside any of the Carbon for IBM.com themes, you will see dropdown selections for Components, Masthead, etc.
3. Click on a dropdown selection to view the associated components.
4. Drag the desired component onto the canvas.

#### Component variants

Some components contain variants that allow you to change the properties of a component such as breakpoint, type, and interactive state. If a component contains variants, you will see them in the Design panel when you select a component. Before making updates directly to a component, check to see if the option is available as a variant.

#### Description and documentation

Some components will contain additional guidance and links to documentation. When selecting a component, check the Design panel for a description and link to any relevant documentation.

### Text styles

Carbon for IBM.com text styles are available in each library.

**To apply text styles to to text**:

1. Have one or more of the Figma libraries active.
2. Select the text to change.
3. In the Design panel > Text, click on the four dot icon.
4. Select the text style to apply. Hover for additional usage guidance.

Text styles within components are carefully considered. It’s important that you do not detach the symbol to change default styles.

### Color styles

Carbon for IBM.com color styles are available in each library.

#### To apply color styles to an element:

1. Have one or more of the Figma libraries active.
2. Select the text to change.
3. In the **Design panel > Text**, click the four dot icon.
4. Select the text style to apply. Hover for additional usage guidance.

### Other Figma resources

#### Bring in colors

Additional color collections live in the IBM Design Systems libraries. In the Libraries overlay in Figma, select or search for “Color Styles - IBM Design Language”.

#### Bring in icons and pictograms

Icons and pictograms live in the IBM Design Systems libraries. In the Libraries overlay in Figma, select or search for “Icons and Pictograms - IBM Design Language”.
