## Learn about expressive styling

Expressive styling is fundamental to all of the designs on Carbon for IBM.com.
Read through the
[Expressive styling pages](../guidelines/expressive-styling/overview) and learn
how to apply the styles correctly and how to use productive styling in tandem,
where appropriate.

<InlineNotification>

**Note:** We recently made changes to the delivery of our expressive styles. You
can read more about it in
[What's happening](https://www.ibm.com/standards/carbon/whats-happening/expressive-update/).

</InlineNotification>

## Install the Sketch kit

We are currently working on a new Sketch kit that will include pre-built
versions of the Carbon for IBM.com components. We will post updates when the new
kit is available.

In the meantime, follow the directions below to begin building out your designs
using elements from the Carbon Expressive Sketch kit.

**1. Install Sketch**

To design with the Carbon Expressive kit you need the most recent version of
[Sketch](https://www.sketch.com) installed.

**2. Set up Box Drive**

If you use Box Sync, you will need to uninstall it to use Box Drive. Follow the
steps on
[Uninstalling Box Sync](https://community.box.com/t5/Using-Box-Sync/Uninstalling-Box-Sync-Manually/ta-p/51105?advanced=false&collapse_discussion=true&filter=location&location=category:English&q=unintall%20box%20sync&search_type=thread)
to uninstall Box Sync. Then follow the steps on
[Installing and Updating Box Drive](https://community.box.com/t5/Getting-Started-with-Box-Drive/Installing-and-Updating-Box-Drive/ta-p/37450)
to install Box Drive.

**3. Request access to the design kit**

Join the [#ibm-design-kit](https://cognitive-app.slack.com/archives/CDT9TSUAJ)
Slack channel and request access to the design kit Box folder by posting your
IBM email. You'll receive an email notification when you have been added to the
Box folder.

**4. Set up Sketch library and templates**

Save the template and library by navigating to the
`IBM Design kit / Digital design / Carbon for IBM.com design kit` folder.

To save the grid template, open the “IBM Design template” file in Sketch, from
the menu choose `File → Save as Template → Save`.

To add the libraries, from Sketch navigate to
`Preferences → Libraries → Add Library` and select
`Box → IBM Design kit → Digital Design → Carbon for IBM.com → Carbon Expressive (White theme)`.
Follow the same instructions for the other theme libraries.

Be sure to add the libraries following the instructions above. The Carbon for
IBM.com team does not recommend downloading the Sketch files to your local drive
because you will not receive any updates.

<InlineNotification>

**Note:** For product design, the
[Carbon kit](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/get-started/design/#get-the-kit)
is available via Sketch Cloud. You do not need access to request access to Box.

</InlineNotification>

### Sketch updates

We make small adjustments and bug fixes to the kit on a regular basis. When we
make a change to any of the libraries, you will be notified via a red pop-up in
the top right corner of the Sketch window.

The updates are opt-in, however we recommend you keep your kit as up to date as
possible. Once a change is accepted, you will not be able to revert to the
previous version.

### Learning Sketch

If you’re brand new to Sketch, they offer some great
[tutorials and documentation](https://www.sketch.com/docs/).

## Get Carbon for IBM.com components

_For IBMers only_: We provide Sketch files of all the Carbon for IBM.com
components, at the different breakpoints. These are available on Box.

You can also get to these component resources from the Design specifications
card on the individual component pages.

As mentioned above, we are working on a new Sketch kit for all of our components
and will post updates when it is available.

## Other Sketch resources

**1. Bring in colors and icons**

Additional color collections live in the IBM Design Language library. Icons live
in two different libraries separated by size.

## Sketch tips

Our Sketch resources are set up to help you design using key IBM assets. Learn
more about using the [2x Grid](designing#2x-grid), [Symbols](designing#symbols),
[Text styles](designing#text-styles), and [Layer styles](designing#layer-styles)
in Sketch.

### 2x Grid

The IBM 2x Grid is the framework for laying out all visual elements.

#### Understanding the grid

For a detailed walkthrough of the 2x Grid, see the foundational 2x Grid guidance
on the Carbon Design System site. The
[Overview](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/2x-grid/overview)
provides the background and design rationale for the 2x Grid.
[Implementation](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/2x-grid/implementation)
will get you up and running, designing with the grid.

For information about using the 2x Grid with web pages, including best
practices, see our [Layout guidelines](../guidelines/layout).

#### Start using the grid

You can find the grid template in the
[IBM Design template file](https://www.sketch.com/s/3a3f3f2d-94d7-4c16-8e2e-88ba80a6382e)
in Sketch.

![Image of sketch showing the grid](../../images/get-started/Designing_Grid_Sketch.jpg)

<Caption>Sketch flyout menus for the IBM Design template</Caption>

The grid template includes templates for all breakpoints along with the
necessary formulas to design for custom screen sizes.

At the top of your screen, navigate to `File → New file from Template` and
select the "IBM Design template" file in Sketch. You'll always be able to find
the template here.

To toggle the grid on and off, use `Control+G`. To toggle the layout guide, use
`Control+L`.

### Symbols

Carbon Expressive components live in the design kit as Sketch symbols.

![Image of sketch showing symbols](../../images/get-started/Designing_Symbols_Sketch.jpg)

#### Library menu navigation 

There are two kinds of symbols — library symbols and document symbols. Library
symbols are available in any Sketch document, while document symbols are
specific to the document in which they are found.

From the Insert menu, select `Symbols → Carbon Expressive` to add symbols onto
your page.

Carbon Expressive symbols are built to be flexible, and designers should not
detach symbols from the library. Once a symbol is detached, you will no longer
receive updates as they are released.

#### Structure

Symbols are organized by components. After selecting a component, you’ll see the
variations and states of that component.

To add the whole component, select the desired variant and place it on your
artboard.

### Text styles

Text styles are based on the typography rules that are defined by the
[IBM Design Language](https://www.ibm.com/design/language/).

To insert a Carbon for IBM.com text style, go to the main menu and select
`Insert → Text Styles → Carbon Expressive`.

Text styles within components are carefully considered. It's important that you
do not detach the symbol to change default styles.

#### Library menu navigation

Carbon for IBM.com text styles in Sketch are organized similarly to symbols.

The menus show the fixed type styles in the first panel. Fixed means that the
type size does not change across different breakpoints. There is also an option
to view the expressive type styles, and these style are fluid which means they
adjust according to breakpoint. Choosing expressive allows you to further select
for the breakpoint, and from there the type style you need. You choose the color
in the final menu.

![Image of sketch showing text styles](../../images/get-started/Designing_TextStyles_Sketch.jpg)

### Layer styles

Layer styles are color selections for any shape in Sketch.

Color in the IBM Design System is carefully considered, and we discourage custom
layer styles. Use predetermined overrides when possible.

#### Library menu navigation 

- The first layer shows the theme selection, that is Carbon Expressive (White
  theme).
- The second layer shows core Carbon Expressive color tokens for the selected
  item, for example `field-01`.
- The interaction state tokens are nested in a third layer under “state”.

## Accessibility

Accessible design not only helps users with disabilities; it provides better
user experiences for everyone. Please view the
<a href="https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/accessibility/overview" target="_blank">Accessibility
guideline</a> on the Carbon website to learn more about the accessibility best
practices.
