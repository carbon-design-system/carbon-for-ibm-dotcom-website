Welcome to Carbon for IBM.com. This page has everything you need to get started designing  web pages for IBM.com.

**Note:** The Expressive Theme has been integrated into Carbon Design System’s core library. This means that expressive continues to be available to IBM.com, but now all Carbon adopters can get both productive and expressive experiences from the same library source. In the next few sprints, we will be shifting to use expressive styling and elements from core, then the Expressive Theme within Carbon for IBM.com will no longer be maintained.

## What's new

#### August 2021 update

For those designers transitioning from the Expressive Theme kit, here is all the stuff to do...
-- Olivia supplying the details. 


## Install the design kits

#### 1. **Install Sketch**.

To design with Carbon you must have the **most recent version** of
[Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/) installed.

#### 2. **Choose a theme**.

There are [four Carbon themes](/guidelines/color/overview#themes), two light
(White and Gray 10) and two dark (Gray 90 and Gray 100). Each theme lives in its
own Sketch library. You can subscribe to as many libraries as you'd like.

  <Column colMd={4} colLg={4} noGutterSm>
    <ResourceCard
      subTitle="White theme"
      href="sketch://add-library/cloud/557b75ff-67d3-41ab-ada5-fa25447218c1"

    >

    >

  </Column>
</Row>

<br />

#### 3. **Bring in additional colors and icons**.

Additional color collections live in the IBM Design Language library. Icons live
in two different libraries separated by size.

<Row className="resource-card-group">
  <Column colMd={4} colLg={4} noGutterSm>
    <ResourceCard
      subTitle="IBM Design Language"
      href="sketch://add-library/cloud/4f1cbe6c-6626-405e-8c46-a9ae41a30cba"
    >

  </Column>

   <Column colMd={4} colLg={4} noGutterSm>
    <ResourceCard
      subTitle="IBM Icons (24, 32px) library"
      href="sketch://add-library/cloud/d530998a-c94c-4f1c-bc0e-c05417e067e3"

    >

</Row>


<br />
<br />

#### 4. **Download the grid template**.

Visit the
[Sketch library](https://www.sketch.com/s/3a3f3f2d-94d7-4c16-8e2e-88ba80a6382e)
page and choose `Download Document` from the right-side panel.

Open the file in Sketch. Navigate to `File → Save as Template`. You can now
access the saved grid template at `File → New file from Template`.

<Row className="resource-card-group">
  <Column colLg={4} colMd={4} noGutterSm>
    <ResourceCard
      subTitle="IBM Grid template"

## Learn about expressive styling

Expressive styling is fundamental to all of the designs on Carbon for IBM.com. Read through the Expressive styling pages and learn how to apply the styles correctly and how to use productive styling in tandem, where appropriate. 


## Start designing

To get started with Carbon, familiarize yourself with the contents of each
library.

#### **Start with the grid**.

At the top of your screen, navigate to `File → New file from Template` and
select your grid template. You'll always be able to find the template here.

#### **Icons and color swatches**.

Symbols from both the IBM Design Language library and the Carbon library are
accessible from any Sketch document. Navigate to
`Insert → Symbols → Carbon Design System` or `IBM Design Language`.

#### **You're all set**.

Refer to the content below for a more detailed breakdown of the kit, or head to
Sketch to begin designing.

## Sketch tips

Here's how to use key IBM assets to get started designing.

### Grid

The IBM 2x Grid is the framework for laying out all visual elements. You can find the grid template inside of the “IBM Design template” file in Sketch. See the [Grid guideline](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/2x-grid/implementation) for a more detailed walkthrough of the 2x Grid.

![Image of sketch showing the grid](../../images/get-started/Designing_Grid_Sketch.jpg)

#### Structure
The grid template includes templates for all breakpoints along with the necessary formulas to design for custom screen sizes.

To toggle the grid on and off, use `Control+G`. To toggle the layout guide, use `Control+L`.

### Symbols

Carbon Expressive components live in the design kit as Sketch symbols.

![Image of sketch showing symbols](../../images/get-started/Designing_Symbols_Sketch.jpg)

#### Library menu navigation 
There are two kinds of symbols — library symbols and document symbols. Library symbols are available in any Sketch document, while document symbols are specific to the document in which they are found.

From the Insert menu, select `Symbols → Carbon Expressive` to add symbols onto your page.

Carbon Expressive symbols are built to be flexible, and designers should not detach symbols from the library. Once a symbol is detached, you will no longer receive updates as they are released.

#### Structure
Symbols are organized by Components; after selecting a component, you’ll see the variations and states of that component.

* To add the whole component, select the desired variant and place it on your artboard.

### Text styles
Text styles are based on the typography rules that are defined by the [IBM Design Language](https://www.ibm.com/design/language/).

![Image of sketch showing text styles](../../images/get-started/Designing_TextStyles_Sketch.jpg)

#### Library menu navigation
From the main menu select `Insert → Text Styles → Carbon Expressive` to insert a Carbon for IBM.com text style.

Text styles within components are carefully considered. We do not recommend detaching the symbol to change default styles.

#### Structure 

Carbon for IBM.com text styles in Sketch are organized similarly to symbols.

#### Fixed sizes
* The first text style level shows the Carbon for IBM.com type token (i.e. body-long-01).
* The second level selects the type color, which is labeled with a Carbon for IBM.com color token name (i.e. text-01).

#### Expressive sizes

* The first text style level displays the expressive type styles.
* The second level shows the breakpoints (i.e. lg (1056)).
* The third level shows the Carbon for IBM.com type token (i.e. body-long-01).
* The fourth level selects the type color, which is labeled with a Carbon for IBM.com color token name (i.e. text-01).


### Layer styles
Layer styles are color selections for any shape in Sketch.

![Image of sketch showing layer styles](../../images/get-started/Designing_LayersStyles_Sketch.jpg)

Use predetermined overrides when possible.

#### Library menu navigation 

Color in the IBM Design System is carefully considered, and we discourage custom layer styles.

* The first layer is the theme selection (i.e. Carbon Expressive (White theme)). 
* The second layer is core Carbon Expressive color tokens (i.e., field-01) for the selected them.
* The interaction state tokens are nested in a third layer under “state”.

## Accessibility

Accessible design not only helps users with disabilities; it provides better user experiences for everyone. Please view the <a href="https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/accessibility/overview" target="_blank">Accessibility guideline</a> on the Carbon website to learn more about the accessibility best practices.

## Tutorials

To help you get started with Carbon for IBM.com, [watch the replays](https://ec.yourlearning.ibm.com/w3/series/10148614?layout=grid0) from the Digital Design Summit to learn about the foundation of Carbon for IBM.com, design resources and how to utilize the design system.

## Info
If you’re brand new to Sketch, they offer some great [tutorials and help docs](https://www.sketch.com/docs/).

### Updates
We make small adjustments and bug fixes to the kit on a regular basis. When we make a change to any of the libraries, you will be notified via a red pop-up in the top right corner of the Sketch window.

The updates are opt-in, however we recommend you keep your kit as up to date as possible. Once a change is accepted, you will not be able to revert to the previous version.

### Support
If you experience any issues while getting set up with Carbon for IBM.com, head over to the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-for-ibm-dotcom-design-kit) and [create an issue](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-for-ibm-dotcom-design-kit/issues/new?assignees=oliviaflory&template=bug-report.md&title=%5BDesign+kit%5D%3A+Brief+description) if your issue does not already exist.
