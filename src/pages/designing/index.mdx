## Install the Sketch kit

**1. Install Sketch**
To design with the Carbon for IBM.com kit and Carbon Expressive kit you must have the most recent version of [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com) installed.

**2. Set up Box Drive**
If you currently use Box Sync, you must uninstall it to use Box Drive. You can follow the steps on [Uninstalling Box Sync](https://community.box.com/t5/Using-Box-Sync/Uninstalling-Box-Sync-Manually/ta-p/51105?advanced=false&collapse_discussion=true&filter=location&location=category:English&q=unintall%20box%20sync&search_type=thread) Manually document to uninstall Box Sync and [Installing and Updating Box Drive](https://community.box.com/t5/Getting-Started-with-Box-Drive/Installing-and-Updating-Box-Drive/ta-p/37450) document to install the Box Drive.

The Carbon for IBM.com team releases frequent updates to the design kit. Follow the instructions above to stay up to date with the latest changes via Box Drive.

**3. Request access**
Join the [#ibm-design-kit](https://cognitive-app.slack.com/archives/CDT9TSUAJ) Slack channel and request access by posting your IBM email. After you send your request, and email will be sent to you when you have been added to the design kit box folder.

**4. Set up Sketch library and templates**

Save the template and library by navigating to the `IBM Design kit / Digital design / Carbon for IBM.com design kit` folder.

To save the grid template, open the “IBM Design template” file in Sketch, from the menu choose `File → save as template → save`.

To add the libraries, from Sketch navigate to `Preferences → Libraries → Add Library` and select `Box → IBM Design kit → Digital design → Carbon for IBM.com → Carbon Expressive (White theme)`.
Follow the same instructions for the other theme libraries.


Be sure to add the libraries following the instructions above. The Carbon for IBM.com team does not recommend downloading the Sketch files to your local drive because you will not receive any updates.

For product design, the [Carbon kit](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/get-started/design/#get-the-kit) is available via Sketch Cloud and you do not have to request access to the box folder.

### Sketch updates

We make small adjustments and bug fixes to the kit on a regular basis. When we make a change to any of the libraries, you will be notified via a red pop-up in the top right corner of the Sketch window.

The updates are opt-in, however we recommend you keep your kit as up to date as possible. Once a change is accepted, you will not be able to revert to the previous version.

### Learning Sketch

If you’re brand new to Sketch, they offer some great [tutorials and documentation](https://www.sketch.com/docs/).


## Additional resources

**1. Bring in colors and icons**

Additional color collections live in the IBM Design Language library. Icons live
in two different libraries separated by size.

**2. Download the grid template**

Visit the
[Sketch library](https://www.sketch.com/s/3a3f3f2d-94d7-4c16-8e2e-88ba80a6382e)
page and choose `Download Document` from the right-side panel.

Open the file in Sketch. Navigate to `File → Save as Template`. You can now
access the saved grid template at `File → New file from Template`.

## Learn about expressive styling

Expressive styling is fundamental to all of the designs on Carbon for IBM.com. Read through the [Expressive styling pages](../guidelines/expressive-styling/overview) and learn how to apply the styles correctly and how to use productive styling in tandem, where appropriate. 

<InlineNotification>

**Note:** The Expressive theme is being integrated into Carbon Design System’s core library. Expressive styling will be available to IBM.com adopters, along with productive styling, and from the same library source. After we shift the expressive assets, the Expressive theme within the Carbon for IBM.com libraries will no longer be maintained.

</InlineNotification>

## Start designing

To get started with Carbon, familiarize yourself with the contents of each
library.

#### **Start with the grid**.

At the top of your screen, navigate to `File → New file from Template` and
select your grid template. You'll always be able to find the template here.

#### **Icons and color swatches**.

Symbols from both the IBM Design Language library and the Carbon library are
accessible from any Sketch document. Navigate to
`Insert → Symbols → Carbon Design System` or `IBM Design Language`.

#### **You're all set**.

Refer to the content below for a more detailed breakdown of the kit, or head to
Sketch to begin designing.

## Sketch tips

Our Sketch resources are set up to help you design using key IBM assets. 

Learn more about using the [IBM 2x Grid](designing#grid), [Symbols](designing#symbols), [Text styles](designing#text-styles), and [Layer styles](designing#layer-styles) in Sketch. 

### Grid

The IBM 2x Grid is the framework for laying out all visual elements. You can find the grid template inside of the “IBM Design template” file in Sketch. See the [Grid guidelines](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/2x-grid/implementation) for a more detailed walkthrough of the 2x Grid.

![Image of sketch showing the grid](../../images/get-started/Designing_Grid_Sketch.jpg)

#### Structure
The grid template includes templates for all breakpoints along with the necessary formulas to design for custom screen sizes.

To toggle the grid on and off, use `Control+G`. To toggle the layout guide, use `Control+L`.

### Symbols

Carbon Expressive components live in the design kit as Sketch symbols.

![Image of sketch showing symbols](../../images/get-started/Designing_Symbols_Sketch.jpg)

#### Library menu navigation 
There are two kinds of symbols — library symbols and document symbols. Library symbols are available in any Sketch document, while document symbols are specific to the document in which they are found.

From the Insert menu, select `Symbols → Carbon Expressive` to add symbols onto your page.

Carbon Expressive symbols are built to be flexible, and designers should not detach symbols from the library. Once a symbol is detached, you will no longer receive updates as they are released.

#### Structure
Symbols are organized by Components; after selecting a component, you’ll see the variations and states of that component.

* To add the whole component, select the desired variant and place it on your artboard.

### Text styles
Text styles are based on the typography rules that are defined by the [IBM Design Language](https://www.ibm.com/design/language/).

![Image of sketch showing text styles](../../images/get-started/Designing_TextStyles_Sketch.jpg)

#### Library menu navigation
From the main menu select `Insert → Text Styles → Carbon Expressive` to insert a Carbon for IBM.com text style.

Text styles within components are carefully considered. We do not recommend detaching the symbol to change default styles.

#### Structure 

Carbon for IBM.com text styles in Sketch are organized similarly to symbols.

#### Fixed sizes
* The first text style level shows the Carbon for IBM.com type token (i.e. body-long-01).
* The second level selects the type color, which is labeled with a Carbon for IBM.com color token name (i.e. text-01).

#### Expressive sizes

* The first text style level displays the expressive type styles.
* The second level shows the breakpoints (i.e. lg (1056)).
* The third level shows the Carbon for IBM.com type token (i.e. body-long-01).
* The fourth level selects the type color, which is labeled with a Carbon for IBM.com color token name (i.e. text-01).


### Layer styles
Layer styles are color selections for any shape in Sketch.

![Image of sketch showing layer styles](../../images/get-started/Designing_LayersStyles_Sketch.jpg)

Use predetermined overrides when possible.

#### Library menu navigation 

Color in the IBM Design System is carefully considered, and we discourage custom layer styles.

* The first layer is the theme selection (i.e. Carbon Expressive (White theme)). 
* The second layer is core Carbon Expressive color tokens (i.e., field-01) for the selected them.
* The interaction state tokens are nested in a third layer under “state”.

## Accessibility

Accessible design not only helps users with disabilities; it provides better user experiences for everyone. Please view the <a href="https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/accessibility/overview" target="_blank">Accessibility guideline</a> on the Carbon website to learn more about the accessibility best practices.
