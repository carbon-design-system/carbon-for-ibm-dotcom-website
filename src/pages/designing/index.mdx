## Install the design kits

<Row>
<Column  colLg={8} colMd={8} colSm={4}>

Carbon for IBM.com has two design kits—Sketch and Figma. By using the kits you
automatically get any updates made by the Carbon for IBM.com team so you don’t
need to go back and change any designs to match the latest release. And when
handing off to your developers there won’t be confusion about the component and
its behaviors.

#### Sketch kit

For previous users of the Expressive Sketch kit, please note that this is no
longer being maintained. We've been working on a new Sketch kit with Carbon for
IBM.com components, and the preliminary version is available on the
[Sketch kit](designing/sketch-kit/) page. This version includes color tokens,
and expressive and productive type styles, and some key Carbon for IBM.com
components. We are continuing to add more components and you will receive
notifications for any library updates within Sketch.

#### Figma kit

We also have a new Figma kit available. This preliminary kit includes all themes
in one, but we are working on breaking the kit into separate themes, and we are
also building Carbon for IBM.com components for use in your Figma designs.

## Learn about expressive styling

Expressive styling is fundamental to all of the designs on Carbon for IBM.com.
Read through the
[Expressive styling pages](../guidelines/expressive-styling/overview) and learn
how to apply the styles correctly and how to use productive styling in tandem,
where appropriate.

**Note:** For more information about recent changes to the delivery of our
expressive styles, check out
[What's happening](https://www.ibm.com/standards/carbon/whats-happening/expressive-update/).

## Accessibility

Accessible design not only helps users with disabilities; it provides better
user experiences for everyone. Please view the <a href="https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/accessibility/overview" target="_blank">Accessibility guidelines</a> on the Carbon website to learn more about the accessibility best practices.
