The Carbon for IBM.com team has developed a Figma design kit that contains v2 components.

</PageDescription>

<InlineNotification>

**The v2 Beta kit is now available!** The _Carbon for IBM.com v2 BETA_ Figma library is now available to internal users. The library is marked as BETA as we continue to add new components and updates.

## Accessing the library

### 1. Installing Figma

IBMers can learn more about accessing Figma in the <a href="https://w3.ibm.com/design/toolbox/#/ui-design-tools/figma/README" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" >Design Toolbox</a>.

### 2. Sign into Figma using IBM SSO

You should be added to the IBM Figma organization automatically once you sign in. You do not need to join or request to join any specific team to access the libraries.

### 3. Turn on the Carbon for IBM.com v2 library.

The `Carbon for IBM.com v2 BETA` library includes components that map to Carbon's four themes, including two light (White and Gray 10) and two dark (Gray 90 and Gray 100).

Inside of a design file, navigate to the **Main menu panel** in the top left of the toolbar (A). Open the menu and select **Libraries** from the list (B).

<Row>
<Column  colLg={8} colMd={8} colSm={4}>

![Adding components from a library](../../images/designing/design-kit/design-kit-I.png)

</Column>
</Row>

Then in the Libraries modal that appears, you can search for the library under Carbon for IBM.com (C) and click the **Add to file** button next to the `Carbon for IBM.com v2 BETA` (D).

<Row>
<Column  colLg={8} colMd={8} colSm={4}>

### Figma tutorials

If you are new to Figma, tutorials are offered on their official <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Figmadesign/playlists?view=50&sort=dd&shelf_id=3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube channel</a>.

### Figma guild

_For IBMers only_: Sign up for the <a href="https://ec.yourlearning.ibm.com/w3/series/10200299" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Figma Guild Series</a> in YourLearning to stay up to date on future Figma Events at IBM. Figma Fridays offer in-depth tutorials and workshops for IBM employees. Recordings are available on the <a href="https://secure.video.ibm.com/channel/23570833/playlist/641336" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Figma Fridays playlist</a> on Watson Media.

## Other Figma libraries

While the Carbon for IBM.com library can be used on its own, there are other libraries in the IBM organization that are useful for designing web pages. You can enable these inside your Figma file, or visit these links (read-only).

## Start designing

Our Figma resources are set up to help you design using key IBM assets. Learn more about using the 2x Grid and Components in Figma below.

### Components

Included in the library are the Carbon for IBM.com components and their variants. To insert a component, go to the **Asset** panel and find the component you would like to use. Drag it from the asset panel onto the canvas.

View the name of the component in the right sidebar. If the component has variants, youâ€™ll see fields underneath the component name to configure the properties and values of that component set.

For more help on how to use Figma components, see the [Figma doc](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360056440594-Create-and-use-variants#Use_variants).

### Grids

The [(v11) All themes - Carbon Design System](<https://www.figma.com/file/YAnB1jKx0yCUL29j6uSLpg/(v11)-All-themes---Carbon-Design-System?type=design&node-id=1756%3A1439&mode=design&t=RrMQrdXVIXGy6pYZ-1>) library comes with grids that can be applied to a frame that will display the appropriate grid layout for all five 2x grid breakpoints.

To enable the grid, select a frame at the appropriate breakpoint width, and select the **Styles** button under **Layout grid** in the right Design panel. Select the appropriate breakpoint to apply the grid to the selected frame.

To learn more about the 2x grid, visit the Carbon Design system [2x Grid](https://carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/2x-grid/overview/) page.

### Color styles

The Dotcom Figma library uses color styles from the `(v11) All themes - Carbon Design System` library. To apply a color style, select an object then in the **Styles** menu you can select a style from the Carbon theme libraries or the IBM Design Language libraries. In addition to applying color styles to objects, you can also apply color styles to text layers.

To learn more about applying color styles in Figma, see the [Figma docs](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040316193).

### Text styles

The Dotcom Figma library uses text styles from the `(v11) Text Styles - IBM Design Language` library. To apply a text style, select a text layer, then in the properties panel, choose a text style from `(v11) Text styles - IBM Design Language`. Use color styles to change the color of a text style.

To learn more about applying text styles in Figma, see the [Figma docs](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039957034-Create-and-Apply-Text-Styles#apply).
