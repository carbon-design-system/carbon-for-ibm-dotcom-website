## Introduction

Carbon for IBM.com was created to build dynamic IBM web pages and digital experiences on IBM.com. The Carbon for IBM.com community continues to evolve, and contributors like you have helped make what is now, and what it will be in the future. 

Contributions are not limited to code. We also encourage feedback, documentation, new designs, and tools in our toolkit. Most contributions begin with a GitHub issue using one of these templates:

- [Ask a question](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-for-ibm-dotcom/issues/new?labels=question&template=question.md)
- [Report a bug](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-for-ibm-dotcom/issues/new?assignees=emerson-pereira%2C+jacobottesen-dgc&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md)
- [Request a feature](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-for-ibm-dotcom/issues/new?assignees=emerson-pereira%2C+jacobottesen-dgc&labels=Feature+request&template=feature_request.md&title=)

## Working in the open

Carbon for IBM.com workstreams and collaboration live on GitHub. All work, discussion, issues, bugs, features, improvements, and comments can be viewed on the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-for-ibm-dotcom).

If there is something that you do not see here, or if you notice something that could be improved, you have two options:

1. **Open an issue for the request.** We’ll review the issue and get back to you with next steps. If we decide the request should be part of our pipeline, we’ll add it to our roadmap. There are never timeline guarantees for requests, but we’ll do our best to give you a reasonable estimate.

2. **Begin the work yourself and contribute it back to Carbon for IBM.com.** We appreciate complete contributions but we will also accept works in progress. You’re welcome to open an issue to surface your work, and we’ll weigh in and help where we can.

Regardless of how you choose to contribute, we encourage you to open an issue as early as possible in the design process.
