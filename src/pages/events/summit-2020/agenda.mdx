<Title>Introduction: This is Carbon for IBM.com</Title><br/>
Introducing the Carbon for IBM.com platform, formally known as the IBM.com Library. This will be a high level walkthrough of all of the offerings and how they can help get your team started on the road to adopting Carbon for your IBM.com application. Jeff Chew, experience technology architect and technology lead for the Digital Design team, will walk through the landscape, before handing off to Kenny Lam, Ariella Gilmore, and Akira Sudoh on a deeper dive using React and Web Components.

<br/>

<Title>Carbon for IBM.com: Using React</Title><br/>
Carbon for IBM.com was first built on React and one of the main offerings from the platform. Led by Digital Design developer members Kenny Lam and Ariella Gilmore, this is a hands-on experience on what will be needed in order to get started on your React-based IBM.com application.

<br/>

<Title>Carbon for IBM.com: Using Web Components</Title><br/>
While our team focused on building Carbon for IBM.com for React in the past year, we are now laser focused on providing the same level of offerings for IBM.com application teams that are not using React. With the sunset of IE11 and classic Edge support, our team is now embracing the more modern native browser standard of Web Components. Learn about custom elements, shadow DOM, and our usage of lit-element/lit-html, and how Carbon for IBM.com Web Components can be bootstrapped in your IBM.com application.
