## Questions

### Digital Design website
Please take some time to explore the content on this website before engaging the Digital Design core team. The site is very comprehensive and most of the guidelines and components are well documented.

### Frequently asked questions
Answers to the most common questions about the design system can be found in the FAQ.

### Slack channels
_Internal IBM users only. The Digital Design core team maintains the following channels and will provide support as time permits._

**Please try searching the Slack channel for your topic first.** Slack’s filtering feature will return more targeted and relevant results. For instance, if you have a technical question about the DataTable component, you could search “DataTable” in Slack and then filter by the #ibm-digital-design channel. 

_Tip: You can start a new search directly from the message box using the /s slash command._
