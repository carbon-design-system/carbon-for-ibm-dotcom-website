### Slack channels
_Internal IBM users only. The Carbon for IBM.com core team maintains the following channels and will provide support as time permits._

**Please try searching the Slack channel for your topic first.** Slack’s filtering feature will return more targeted and relevant results. For instance, if you have a technical question about the DataTable component, you could search “DataTable” in Slack and then filter by the #ibm-digital-design channel. 

_Tip: You can start a new search directly from the message box using the /s slash command._
