Hello!  We have news to share - the Expressive Theme has been integrated into Carbon Design System's core library.  So what does this mean for teams using Carbon for IBM.com?  It simply means that expressive continues to be available to IBM.com, but now all Carbon adopters can get both productive and expressive experiences from the same library source.

## Background
Two years ago, Carbon Expressive Theme was introduced as a wrapper within the Carbon for IBM.com library, quietly bumping up type sizes and container heights when needed.  

The reason for the Carbon Expressive Theme was so IBM.com page makers could deliver an expressive digital experience while still being compliant with Carbon, which at the time, only contained productive components - more compact and smaller type.  While Expressive Theme solved the need, it led to a more convoluted process when smaller type styles and compact components were also needed on IBM.com.

So DDS worked closely with the core Carbon team and came to an agreement that both Expressive and Productive styling are foundational to the IBM Design Language, and should be delivered from the same source. Removing Carbon Expressive Theme from our library — and shifting to depend on Carbon's core library for the expressive elements — will open up IBM.com to move fluidly between expressive and productive experiences based on user needs.

## What's changed

Previously, the Carbon Expressive Theme adjustments applied to all components of Carbon Design System. To make design decisions easier for our adopters, DDS and Carbon decided to simplify the expressive options to only the components essential to long form reading and call-to-actions:
- Button
- Link
- List


We also added additional type tokens to pair with the larger type styles used in expressive experiences:


| Text usage | Productive token | Expressive token (new) |
| ---------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| Caption    | `$caption-01`   | `$caption-02`    |
| Label      | `$label-01`     | `$label-02` |
| Helper text | `$helper-text-01` | `$helper-text-02` |


## Next step

Continue to deliver an expressive digital experience

#### Designers

- The Carbon Expressive Sketch kit will no longer be maintained. Please find the expressive components and type styles in [Carbon's Design kit](https://carbondesignsystem.com/designing/kits/sketch/).
- For guidance on how to design an Expressive experience for IBM.com, please see *Expressive experience* (coming soon).

#### Developers 

- For adopters using Carbon for IBM.com library, the change will not affect your site or application.
- If you are manually bringing in the Expressive Theme, please be prepared to remove it from your application code. You may migrate to use Carbon for IBM.com, or Carbon's core library where expressive components and type styles are maintained.
