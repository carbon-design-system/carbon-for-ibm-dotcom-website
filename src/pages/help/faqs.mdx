### What is Carbon for IBM.com?

Carbon for IBM.com is a resource for the community of designers and developers involved in building IBM web pages and digital experiences. Its goal is to implement the IBM Design Language, which expresses IBM’s brand values across all customer touch points, both product and web. Carbon for IBM.com is the design system that replaces Northstar [v18](https://www.ibm.com/standards/web/v18/design/), [v19a](https://www.ibm.com/standards/web/v19a-archive/) and even older versions like v17.

### What is Carbon?

Carbon Design System aka [Carbon](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com) is how the IBM Design Language is implemented across IBM products. Choosing Carbon as the strategic solution for Carbon for IBM.com ensures IBM has one consolidate design system across product and web. Carbon for IBM.com works alongside Carbon to produce components, patterns and guidelines to leverage IDL for IBM.com’s more expressive nature.

### Is Carbon for IBM.com ready to use?

Yes! You can reach out to our team at [#carbon-for-ibm-dotcom](https://ibm-studios.slack.com/archives/C2PLX8GQ6) with any questions. We also have weekly [design](https://ec.yourlearning.ibm.com/w3/event/10323408) and biweekly [development](https://ibm.biz/carbon-dev-office-hours) office hours for live support.

### When will v18 (Northstar) be sunset?

Northstar is in maintenance. This means no new enhancements and will only be updated for security patches. It will remain in place through 2023 with limited support but adopters are encouraged to make plans to migrate to Carbon for IBM.com as soon as possible. In 2019, it was announced that Carbon is the overall strategic direction for IBM web and product experiences.
