### What is IBM.com Library?
IBM.com Library is a resource for the community of designers and developers involved in building IBM web pages and digital experiences. Its goal is to implement the IBM Design Language, which expresses IBM’s brand values across all customer touch points, both product and web.  IBM.com Library is the design system that replaces Northstar [v18](https://www.ibm.com/standards/web/v18/design/), [v19a](https://www.ibm.com/standards/web/faq.html) and even older versions like v17.

### What is Carbon?
Carbon Design System aka [Carbon](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com) is how the IBM Design Language is implemented across IBM products. Choosing Carbon as the strategic solution for IBM.com Library ensures IBM has one consolidate design system across product and web. IBM.com Library works alongside Carbon to produce themes, components, patterns and guidelines to leverage IDL for IBM.com’s more expressive nature.

### What happened to Duo?
“Duo” was the codename for the redesign and revamp of the IBM Design Ethos and Language. This effort is still being carried out today throughout all of IBM Design. The new IBM Design Ethos and Language is directly influencing the evolution of IBM.com Library.

### Is IBM.com Library ready to use? 
It depends.  If your pages are on Drupal, the rollout of Carbon on Drupal is happening in 2020 with a new release of Drupal Publishing. If you are designing a new page/site or doing a re-design on a page, you can get started now with IBM.com Library and get familiar with the new dotcom library code. If you are with IBM Cloud and Watson marketing, v19a will continue for limited use until Drupal adopts Carbon in 2020.

### When will v18 (Northstar) be sunset?
Northstar is in steady state now.  This means no new enhancements. It will remain in place in 2020 with limited support but adopters are encouraged to make plans to migrate to IBM.com Library in 2020. In 2019, Ginni Rometty announced that Carbon is the overall strategic direction for IBM web and product experiences.
