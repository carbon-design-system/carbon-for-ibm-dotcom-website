## Choose your framework

Carbon for IBM.com is available in either <Link to="/developing/frameworks/web-components">Web Components</Link>, <Link to="/developing/frameworks/react-wrapper">React wrapper</Link>, or <Link to="/developing/frameworks/react">React</Link>. Choosing a framework would depend on the needs of your application.

### Web components

Web components is the new browser standard with native support, supported in all modern browsers. This uses the Custom
Elements v1 and Shadow DOM v1 specs. Adding web components to your application is as simple as adding custom HTML markup
to your pages! Web components also comes with performance benefits of less scripting cost on page render compared to
using current framework solutions. More importantly, web components can be used in tandem with any framework(s) included
on the page.

Web components are also fully rendered in Google search crawlers (which currently holds the largest market share for
search engines), with light support in other crawlers like Bing and Yahoo.

If you're running an Angular, Vue, or vanilla application, our team recommends using web components. Web components
would also work in React applications. Our team provides <Link to="/developing/frameworks/react-wrapper">React wrapper</Link>
versions of Carbon for IBM.com Web Components.

### React

<InlineNotification kind="warning">

**Note:** The [@carbon/ibmdotcom-react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@carbon/ibmdotcom-react) package will be deprecated in Carbon for IBM.com V2. This package will fall into maintaince-mode, with updates only for potential security issues and high severity bugs. For an estimated timeline on the V2 release, you can view the Carbon for IBM.com [roadmap](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/carbon-for-ibmcom-5d449f3642eb1962336cbe52/roadmap). In Carbon for IBM.com V2, [@carbon/ibmdotcom-web-components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@carbon/ibmdotcom-web-components) will be the main package moving forward. Applications using React can use the [react-wrapper](/developing/frameworks/react-wrapper) components supported by the the Carbon for IBM.com Web Components package.

</InlineNotification>

React is also supported by our team. One of the most popular front-end frameworks today, it is the front-end framework
that is also supported by the core Carbon Design System team. If your application runs on React, our team recommends
Carbon for IBM.com React.
