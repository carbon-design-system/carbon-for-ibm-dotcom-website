## Carbon for IBM.com

Carbon for IBM.com provides front-end developers and engineers a collection of reusable components to build websites and 
user interfaces quickly and efficiently. Adopting the library enables developers to use consistent markup, styles, and 
behavior in prototype and production work.

The Expressive Theme has been integrated into Carbon Design System's core library. It simply means that expressive continues to be available to IBM.com, but now all Carbon adopters can get both productive and expressive experiences from the same [package](URL needed).

<br />

## Get Started 

### Building for IBM.com

All pages on IBM.com must follow various standards and configurations, regardless of framework chosen. To read more, 
visit [Building for IBM.com](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-for-ibm-dotcom/blob/master/docs/building-for-ibm-dotcom.md).

### IBM.com Shell

If you are looking to get started on a page, you can make use of the `<DotcomShell>`, which is a UI Shell that 
contains the `<Masthead>` and the `<Footer>`, using Carbon's grid. 

View the React version at [Storybook React](https://ibmdotcom-react.mybluemix.net/?path=/story/components-dotcom-shell--default).

View the Web Components version at [Storybook Web Components](http://ibmdotcom-web-components.mybluemix.net/?path=/story/components-dotcom-shell--default).
  
### NextJS Template

If you are looking to build out a light static site, the 
[NextJS template](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-for-ibm-dotcom-nextjs-template) is available (using the 
React version of the Carbon for IBM.com). This includes the default configurations for the `<DotcomShell>`, as well as 
some sample components to get you started.

### Expressive Theme

The Expressive Theme has been integrated into Carbon Design System's core library. The expressive theme for Carbon components is available in [Carbon Styles package](URL needed).

You can learn more about the expressive theme on the [Expressive theme guideline page](https://www.ibm.com/standards/web/carbon-for-ibm-dotcom/guidelines/expressive-theme).

## Packages

Carbon for IBM.com comes with a variety of packages. While the main package used would be either [React](https://ibmdotcom-react.mybluemix.net)
or [Web Components](https://ibmdotcom-web-components.mybluemix.net), there are also separate packages that can be 
utilized as their own standalone functionality.
