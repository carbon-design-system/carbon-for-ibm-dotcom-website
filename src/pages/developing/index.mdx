Rapidly build beautiful and accessible experiences. Carbon for IBM.com contains all the resources you need to get started.

**Note:** The Expressive Theme has been integrated into Carbon Design System's core library.  This means that expressive continues to be available to IBM.com, but now all Carbon adopters can get both productive and expressive experiences from the same library source. We are shifting to use core library in the next few months, then Expressive Theme will no longer be maintained.

## Carbon for IBM.com

Carbon for IBM.com provides front-end developers and engineers a collection of reusable components to build websites and
user interfaces quickly and efficiently. Adopting the library enables developers to use consistent markup, styles, and
behavior in prototype and production work.

## Get Started

### Building for IBM.com

All pages on IBM.com must follow various standards and configurations, regardless of framework chosen. To read more,
visit [Building for IBM.com](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-for-ibm-dotcom/blob/master/docs/building-for-ibm-dotcom.md).

### IBM.com Shell

If you are looking to get started on a page, you can make use of the `<DotcomShell>`, which is a UI Shell that
contains the `<Masthead>` and the `<Footer>`, using Carbon's grid. 

View the React version at [Storybook React](https://ibmdotcom-react.mybluemix.net/?path=/story/components-dotcom-shell--default).

View the Web Components version at [Storybook Web Components](http://ibmdotcom-web-components.mybluemix.net/?path=/story/components-dotcom-shell--default).

### NextJS Template

If you are looking to build out a light static site, the
[NextJS template](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-for-ibm-dotcom-nextjs-template) is available (using the
React version of the Carbon for IBM.com). This includes the default configurations for the `<DotcomShell>`, as well as
some sample components to get you started.

## Packages

Carbon for IBM.com comes with a variety of packages. While the main package used would be either [React](https://ibmdotcom-react.mybluemix.net)
or [Web Components](https://ibmdotcom-web-components.mybluemix.net), there are also separate packages that can be
utilized as their own standalone functionality.
