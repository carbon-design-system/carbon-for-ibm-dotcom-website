## Choose your framework

Carbon for IBM.com is available in <Link to="/developing/frameworks/web-components">web components</Link>, or <Link to="/developing/frameworks/react-wrapper">React wrapper</Link> for web components. Choosing a framework would depend on the needs of your application.

### Web components

Web components is the new browser standard with native support, supported in all modern browsers. This uses the Custom
Elements v1 and Shadow DOM v1 specs. Adding web components to your application is as simple as adding custom HTML markup
to your pages! Web components also comes with performance benefits of less scripting cost on page render compared to
using current framework solutions. More importantly, web components can be used in tandem with any framework(s) included
on the page.

Web components are also fully rendered in Google search crawlers (which currently holds the largest market share for
search engines), with light support in other crawlers like Bing and Yahoo.

If you're running an Angular, Vue, or vanilla application, our team recommends using web components. Web components
would also work in React applications. Our team provides <Link to="/developing/frameworks/react-wrapper">React wrapper</Link>
versions of Carbon for IBM.com Web Components.
