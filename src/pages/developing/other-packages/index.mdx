In addition to the frameworks, Carbon for IBM.com comes with modular packages for styles, services, and utilities.

</PageDescription>

## Modular packages

In addition to the framework packages (<Link to="/developing/frameworks/web-components">Web Components</Link> and <Link to="/developing/frameworks/react">React</Link>),
there are other public packages available that are used within the framework packages, and could also be used as
isolated modular functionality and styling within an application.

### Styles

In order to share styles across the framework packages, styles have been separated into its own standalone package. The
styles package also includes the <Link to="/guidelines/expressive-theme">expressive theme</Link>.

<InlineNotification>

**Note:** The expressive theme has been integrated into Carbon Design Systemâ€™s core library. This means that expressive
continues to be available to IBM.com, but now all Carbon adopters can get both productive and expressive experiences
from the same library source. This change will be seamless for current users of Carbon for IBM.com. In the next few
sprints, we will be shifting to use expressive styling and elements from core, after which the expressive theme within
Carbon for IBM.com will no longer be maintained. <Link to="/help/expressive-update">Learn more about this change</Link>.
