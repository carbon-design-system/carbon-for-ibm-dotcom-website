<PageDescription>

Our team builds new components for Carbon for IBM.com as web components first. Anything that currently does not exist in the React framework, is provided as a web component with a React wrapper for seamless integration into a React application.

## Why React wrappers?

When using web components, other frameworks such as Angular and Vue require limited to no changes in the application, but React has some issues. React heavily relies on its knowledge with regard to how intrinsic HTML elements work. In order to solve these issues,
our team created the React wrapper components.

## Install via import

Using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```bash
npm install -S @carbon/ibmdotcom-web-components
```

Using [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/):

```bash
yarn add @carbon/ibmdotcom-web-components
```

### lit-html / lit-element

`@carbon/ibmdotcom-web-components` uses [`lit-html`](https://lit-html.polymer-project.org) for reactive templating on
top of the Web Components standard, and [`lit-element`](https://lit-element.polymer-project.org) for reactive
properties/attributes on top of `lit-html`. These are already installed as `dependencies` within the project.

## Getting started

1. These components require the use of [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) in
   your project. See our
   [`webpack.config.js`](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-for-ibm-dotcom/blob/main/packages/web-components/examples/codesandbox/components-react/button-group/webpack.config.js)
   for a simple example configuration.
2. Since these components are being generated from the Carbon for IBM.com Web Component library, the components will import all of the styles themselves.

## NextJS template

If you are looking to build out a light static site, the
[NextJS template](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-for-ibm-dotcom-nextjs-template) is available (using the
React version of the Carbon for IBM.com). We also have a [NextJS test](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-for-ibm-dotcom-nextjs-test) page
setup which includes both React and React wrapper components.

## Using with Carbon Web Components

Carbon for IBM.com Web Components uses the Carbon Web Components library (`carbon-web-components`) under the hood.
When building your IBM.com application, both libraries can be used together. Carbon Web Components is the web component
version of core Carbon Design System. Just like how Carbon for IBM.com offers React wrappers, Carbon Web Components also offers React wrappers.
[Learn more about Carbon Web Components](https://carbondesignsystem.com/developing/frameworks/web-components).
The pure Carbon React library (`@carbon/react`) can also be used with the React wrappers.
