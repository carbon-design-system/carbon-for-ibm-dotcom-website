<InlineNotification kind="warning">

**Note:** The [@carbon/ibmdotcom-react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@carbon/ibmdotcom-react) package will be deprecated in Carbon for IBM.com V2. This package will fall into maintaince-mode, with updates only for potential security issues and high severity bugs. For an estimated timeline on the V2 release, you can view the Carbon for IBM.com [roadmap](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-for-ibm-dotcom#workspaces/carbon-for-ibmcom-5d449f3642eb1962336cbe52/roadmap). In Carbon for IBM.com V2, [@carbon/ibmdotcom-web-components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@carbon/ibmdotcom-web-components) will be the main package moving forward. Applications using React can use the [react-wrapper](/developing/frameworks/react-wrapper) components supported by the the Carbon for IBM.com Web Components package.

## Install

Using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```bash
npm i @carbon/ibmdotcom-react
```

Using [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/):

```bash
yarn add @carbon/ibmdotcom-react
```

## Getting started

1. These components require the use of [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) in
   your project. See our
   [`webpack.config.js`](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-for-ibm-dotcom/blob/main/packages/react/.storybook/webpack.config.js)
   for an example configuration.

2. Components do not import any of the styles themselves, use the scss or css
   from `@carbon/ibmdotcom-styles` to bring in styling.

### Styles

Styles are in a separate package entirely, as they are considered to be
framework agnostic and can be used with any framework.
[Learn how to include styles here](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-for-ibm-dotcom/blob/main/packages/styles/README.md).

## IBM.com shell

If you are looking to get started on a page, you can make use of the `<DotcomShell>`, which is a UI shell that
contains the `<Masthead>` and the `<Footer>`, using Carbon's grid.

View the `<DotcomShell>` in [Storybook React](https://www.ibm.com/standards/carbon/react/?path=/story/components-dotcom-shell--default).

## NextJS template

If you are looking to build out a light static site, the
[NextJS template](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-for-ibm-dotcom-nextjs-template) is available (using the
React version of the Carbon for IBM.com). This includes the default configurations for the `<DotcomShell>`, as well as
some sample components to get you started.

## Using with Carbon React

Carbon for IBM.com React uses the Carbon React library (`carbon-components-react`) under the hood. When building your
IBM.com application, both libraries can be used together. [Learn more about Carbon React](<a href="https://carbondesignsystem.com/developing/frameworks/react/">).
