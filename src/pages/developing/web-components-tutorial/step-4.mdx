## Preview

A [preview]() of what you'll build:

<Preview
  height="400"
  title="Carbon for IBM.com Tutorial Step 4"
  src="https://carbon-design-system.github.io/carbon-for-ibm-dotcom-tutorial/step-5/"
  frameborder="no"
  allowtransparency="true"
  allowfullscreen="true"
/>

## Fork, clone, and branch

This tutorial has an accompanying GitHub repository called
[carbon-for-ibm-dotcom-tutorial](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-for-ibm-dotcom-tutorial) that we'll use
as a starting point for each step. If you haven't forked and cloned that repository yet, and haven't added the upstream
remote, go ahead and do so by following the <Link to="/developing/web-components-tutorial">step 1 instructions</Link>.

### Branch

With your repository all set up, let's check out the branch for this tutorial step's starting point.

```bash
git fetch upstream
git checkout -b web-components-step-4 upstream/web-components-step-4
```

<InlineNotification>

**Note:** This builds on top of step 3, but be sure to check out the upstream step 4 branch because it includes some of the
components required to get through this step.

</InlineNotification>

## Component documentation

In this step, you'll be adding to the page 6 pure Carbon components to the page.
These components will be showcased at the bottom using the `Tabs` components, to give you a brief look at how they would look in a page.

The following components that will be used in step 4 are:

- [Carbon tag](https://web-components.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/story/components-tag--default)
- [Tag group](https://ibmdotcom-web-components-canary.mybluemix.net/?path=/story/components-tag-group--default)
- [Tabs](https://web-components.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/story/components-tabs--default)
- [Data table](https://web-components.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/story/components-data-table--default)
- [Dropdown](https://web-components.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/story/components-dropdown--default)
- [Radio button](https://web-components.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/story/components-radio-button--default)
- [Structured list](https://web-components.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/story/components-structured-list--default)

All the components have implementation details in the linked Storybook Docs tab. The Docs tab has a link to the codesandbox example of each component, props table to showcase different variations possible, and other
key information. This is a great place to look back to if you're ever stuck.

For more background on how `Card` uses Carbon `Tag`, checkout the info
on our website <Link to="/components/cards">here</Link>.

## Add Tag group and Carbon Tag

While many of our components are already built using Carbon, we can still incorporate some of these into our Carbon for IBM.com components.

As a practice run, let's try adding a Carbon `Tag` component into one of our `Card group item` components that we added in Step 3.
We will also be adding a slotted `Tag group` component within to house the `Tag`s inside the `Card`.

First, let's add the following import to our `app.js` file:

```javascript path=src/assets/js/app.js
import 'carbon-web-components/es/components/tag/tag';
```

<InlineNotification>

**Note:** `<dds-card>` already imports the `<dds-tag-group` component on its own,
so there's no need to manually import it.

</InlineNotification>

With the imported included, we can now build the `Tag Group` component, adding two `Tag` components within.
The default color for the `Tag` is green, but we can make the second `Tag` become purple using the `type` attribute.

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```html path=src/index.html
    <dds-tag-group>
      <bx-tag>
        Most popular
      </bx-tag>
      <bx-tag type="purple">
        Enterprise
      </bx-tag>
    </dds-tag-group>
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

Next, let's take a quick look at the `Card group` component we added in Step 3:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```html path=src/index.html
    <dds-card-group>
      <dds-card-group-item cta-type='local' href='https://example.com'>
        <dds-image slot="image" alt="Image alt text" default-src="./assets/images/WC-tutorial-example--client-story-card1.jpg"></dds-image>
        <dds-card-eyebrow>IBM Watson Discovery</dds-card-eyebrow>
        <dds-card-heading>Citi Bank transforms internal audit practice</dds-card-heading>
        <!-- tag group here -->
        <dds-card-cta-footer cta-type='local'>
        </dds-card-cta-footer>
      </dds-card-group-item>
      <dds-card-group-item cta-type='local' href='https://example.com'>
        <dds-image slot="image" alt="Image alt text" default-src="./assets/images/WC-tutorial-example--client-story-card2.jpg"></dds-image>
        <dds-card-eyebrow>IBM Cloud Pak</dds-card-eyebrow>
        <dds-card-heading>ING carries out data fabric vision</dds-card-heading>
        <dds-card-cta-footer cta-type='local'>
        </dds-card-cta-footer>
      </dds-card-group-item>
      <dds-card-group-item cta-type='local' href='https://example.com'>
        <dds-image slot="image" alt="Image alt text" default-src="./assets/images/WC-tutorial-example--client-story-card3.jpg"></dds-image>
        <dds-card-eyebrow>IBM Cloud Pak for Data</dds-card-eyebrow>
        <dds-card-heading>Innocence tackles neonate mortality rates with AI</dds-card-heading>
        <dds-card-cta-footer cta-type='local'>
        </dds-card-cta-footer>
      </dds-card-group-item>
    </dds-card-group>
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

Let's focus on adding `Tag group` to the first `Card group item`
by replacing the `<!-- tag-group -->`:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```html path=src/index.html
    <dds-card-group-item cta-type='local' href='https://example.com'>
      <dds-image slot="image" alt="Image alt text" default-src="./assets/images/WC-tutorial-example--client-story-card1.jpg"></dds-image>
      <dds-card-eyebrow>IBM Watson Discovery</dds-card-eyebrow>
      <dds-card-heading>Citi Bank transforms internal audit practice</dds-card-heading>
      <dds-tag-group>
        <bx-tag>
          Most popular
        </bx-tag>
        <bx-tag type="purple">
          Enterprise
        </bx-tag>
      </dds-tag-group>
      <dds-card-cta-footer cta-type='local'>
      </dds-card-cta-footer>
    </dds-card-group-item>
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

Great! You just added your first Carbon component into your page.
Now that we're over the first hurdle, let's add a couple more to showcase at the bottom of the page.

## Add Content block

To ensure the Carbon components align with the rest of the page, let's add `Content block` within a `Content section`
as we've done in the previous step.

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```html path=src/index.html
      <a name="6" data-title="Carbon components"></a>
      <dds-content-section>
        <dds-content-section-heading>Carbon components</dds-content-section-heading>
          <dds-content-block>
            <dds-content-block-heading>What is Carbon?</dds-content-block-heading>
            <dds-content-block-copy>Carbon is IBM’s open source design system for products and digital experiences. With the IBM Design Language as its foundation, the system consists of working code, design tools and resources, human interface guidelines, and a vibrant community of contributors.</dds-content-block-copy>
            <!-- Tabs and content here -->
        </dds-content-block>
      </dds-content-section>
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

## Add Tabs

You're getting the hang of it!
Now, let's add the `Tabs` component, which will contain four tab buttons that will make it so the user
can switch between the remaining four components we will add in the next couple steps.

As always, add the correct import for the component in your `app.js` file:

```javascript path=src/assets/js/app.js
import 'carbon-web-components/es/components/tabs/index';
```

Then, add the component markup in your file:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```html path=src/index.html
    <bx-tabs value="table">
      <bx-tab id="table" target="panel-table" value="table">Data table</bx-tab>
      <bx-tab id="list" target="panel-list" value="list">Structured ist</bx-tab>
      <bx-tab id="dropdown" target="panel-dropdown" value="dropdown">Dropdown</bx-tab>
      <bx-tab id="radio-buttons" target="panel-radio-buttons" value="radio-buttons">Radio buttons</bx-tab>
    </bx-tabs>
    <div class='bx--tab-panels'>
      <!-- add individual tab divs here -->
    </div>
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

As you probably noted, we will have to add an additional `div` right after the `Tabs` component to ensure the
tabbing functionality works as expected. The attribute seen in each `Tab` component are also necessary
for the tab-switching logic to work, so it's important to name them appropiately.

The `bx--tab-panels` class can be added in your stylesheet to accomodate a small space between components within the tab space.

```css path=src/assets/scss/app.scss
.bx--tab-panels {
  flex: 1;
  padding: 1rem;
  align-self: stretch;
}
```

Nice job! Next up, adding the actual components!

## Add Data table

To give you an idea of how useful Carbon components can be in your page, we'll be adding a `Data table` component.

Add the `Data table` import:

```javascript path=src/assets/js/app.js
import 'carbon-web-components/es/components/data-table/index';
```

As mentioned before, we'll have to add a `div` containing the `id` attribute with the same value as the `target` attribute
from the according `Tab` component, and wrap it around the `Table` component.

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```html path=src/index.html
    <div id="panel-table" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="table">
      <bx-table>
        <bx-table-head>
          <bx-table-header-row>
            <bx-table-header-cell>Name</bx-table-header-cell>
            <bx-table-header-cell>Protocol</bx-table-header-cell>
            <bx-table-header-cell>Port</bx-table-header-cell>
            <bx-table-header-cell>Rule</bx-table-header-cell>
            <bx-table-header-cell>Attached Groups</bx-table-header-cell>
            <bx-table-header-cell>Status</bx-table-header-cell>
          </bx-table-header-row>
        </bx-table-head>
        <bx-table-body>
          <bx-table-row>
            <bx-table-cell>Load Balancer 1</bx-table-cell>
            <bx-table-cell>HTTP</bx-table-cell>
            <bx-table-cell>80</bx-table-cell>
            <bx-table-cell>Round Robin</bx-table-cell>
            <bx-table-cell>Maureen's VM Groups</bx-table-cell>
            <bx-table-cell>Active</bx-table-cell>
          </bx-table-row>         
          <bx-table-row>
            <bx-table-cell>Load Balancer 2</bx-table-cell>
            <bx-table-cell>HTTP</bx-table-cell>
            <bx-table-cell>80</bx-table-cell>
            <bx-table-cell>Round Robin</bx-table-cell>
            <bx-table-cell>Maureen's VM Groups</bx-table-cell>
            <bx-table-cell>Active</bx-table-cell>
          </bx-table-row>  
          <bx-table-row>
            <bx-table-cell>Load Balancer 3</bx-table-cell>
            <bx-table-cell>HTTP</bx-table-cell>
            <bx-table-cell>80</bx-table-cell>
            <bx-table-cell>Round Robin</bx-table-cell>
            <bx-table-cell>Maureen's VM Groups</bx-table-cell>
            <bx-table-cell>Active</bx-table-cell>
          </bx-table-row>   
        </bx-table-body>
      </bx-table>
    </div>
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

Looking good! We will now add two interactive components

## Add Dropdown and Radio buttons

We'll be importing `Radio button` this time -- `Dropdown` has already been included as part of the `Footer`,
so there's no need to explicitly import it again.

```javascript path=src/assets/js/app.js
import 'carbon-web-components/es/components/radio-button/index';
```

As with `Data table`, we need to wrap around the components with their proper `id` accordingly.
Note that we're also adding an extra `div` wrapper to include specific classes to ensure the
components are centered within the Tab container.

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```html path=src/index.html
    <div id="panel-dropdown" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="dropdown">
      <div class="bx--col-lg-8 bx--offset-lg-4 bx--no-gutter">
        <bx-dropdown trigger-content='Select theme'>
          <bx-dropdown-item value='white-theme'>White theme</bx-dropdown-item>
          <bx-dropdown-item value='g10-theme'>Gray 10 theme</bx-dropdown-item>
          <bx-dropdown-item value='g90-theme'>Gray 90 theme</bx-dropdown-item>
          <bx-dropdown-item value='dark-theme'>Dark theme</bx-dropdown-item>
        </bx-dropdown>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div id="panel-radio-buttons" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="radio-buttons">
      <div class="bx--col-lg-10 bx--offset-lg-2 bx--no-gutter">
        <bx-radio-button-group name='theme-changer'>
          <bx-radio-button value='white-theme' label-text='White theme'></bx-radio-button>
          <bx-radio-button value='g10-theme' label-text='Gray 10 theme'></bx-radio-button>
          <bx-radio-button value='g90-theme' label-text='Gray 90 theme'></bx-radio-button>
          <bx-radio-button value='dark-theme' label-text='Dark theme'></bx-radio-button>
        </bx-radio-button-group>
      </div>
    </div>
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

Currently, nothing happens when interacting with these components, but we'll come back to this later.

## Add Structured list

Last but not least, we'll be adding `Structured list` following the same method we've been doing.

Let's import the final component:

```javascript path=src/assets/js/app.js
import 'carbon-web-components/es/components/radio-button/index';
```

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```html path=src/index.html
    <div id="panel-list" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="list">
      <bx-structured-list>
        <bx-structured-list-head>
          <bx-structured-list-header-row>
            <bx-structured-list-header-cell>Cell A</bx-structured-list-header-cell>
            <bx-structured-list-header-cell>Cell B</bx-structured-list-header-cell>
            <bx-structured-list-header-cell>Cell C</bx-structured-list-header-cell>
          </bx-structured-list-header-row>
        </bx-structured-list-head>
        <bx-structured-list-body>
          <bx-structured-list-row>
            <bx-structured-list-cell>Row 1</bx-structured-list-cell>
            <bx-structured-list-cell>Row 1</bx-structured-list-cell>
            <bx-structured-list-cell>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nunc dui magna, finibus id tortor sed, aliquet bibendum augue. Aenean posuere sem vel euismod dignissim.</bx-structured-list-cell>
          </bx-structured-list-row>
          <bx-structured-list-row>
            <bx-structured-list-cell>Row 2</bx-structured-list-cell>
            <bx-structured-list-cell>Row 2</bx-structured-list-cell>
            <bx-structured-list-cell>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nunc dui magna, finibus id tortor sed, aliquet bibendum augue. Aenean posuere sem vel euismod dignissim.</bx-structured-list-cell>
          </bx-structured-list-row>
          <bx-structured-list-row>
            <bx-structured-list-cell>Row 3</bx-structured-list-cell>
            <bx-structured-list-cell>Row 3</bx-structured-list-cell>
            <bx-structured-list-cell>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nunc dui magna, finibus id tortor sed, aliquet bibendum augue. Aenean posuere sem vel euismod dignissim.</bx-structured-list-cell>
          </bx-structured-list-row>
        </bx-structured-list-body>
      </bx-structured-list>
    </div>
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

And thus, you have just added the final component.
Good job, give yourself a pat in the back!

Just one more activity before we can proceed to Step 5.

## Capture custom events

If you looked into the Carbon Web Components Storybook for the components we used, you might have had seen some activity
happening in the `Actions` menu after interacting with the components. These are known as events, and for this section
we will be capturing one and make something happen within our page.

Looking at the components' documentation, the events' names are `bx-dropdown-selected` and `bx-radio-button-group-changed`
for the `Dropdown` and `Radio button` components, respectively.

We will be using these events to change the page's theme to the selected option.

For that to happen, we will set up the classes containing the remaining themes, as well as slightly refactor
our `.dark-theme` class we created in Step 2.

```css path=src/assets/scss/app.scss
.g10-theme {
  @include carbon--theme($carbon--theme--g10, true);
}

.g90-theme {
  @include carbon--theme($carbon--theme--g90, true);
}

.dark-theme {
  @include carbon--theme($carbon--theme--g100, true);
}

*[class$='-theme'] {
  background-color: var(--cds-ui-background);
  color: var(--cds-text-01);
}
```

Notice the last selector, which will ensure the rules using our color tokens are used in all classes ending in `-theme` to
avoid repeated code. As our components are already using the `White` theme by default, we don't need to create a class for it.

Now that we have these classes set up in our stylesheet, let's add a `script` element at the bottom of our `index.html` file:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```html path=src/index.html
   <style>
    function changeTheme(event) {
      const { value } = event.detail.item || event.detail;
      document.body.classList.value = value;
    }
    
    document.addEventListener('bx-dropdown-selected', changeTheme)
    document.addEventListener('bx-radio-button-group-changed', changeTheme)
   </style>
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

This JavaScript code will add an event listener to the document, which will capture both events when fired.
Once captured, the `changeTheme` function will run, and will grab the value of the selected item, which we
aptly named after our classes.

It will then add the class to the `body` element, which will ensure the whole page's theme changes accordingly.

...and voila! We just used Carbon components to our advantage by adding a small but cool feature!

The possibilities are endless with custom events, feel free to play around with them some more!
