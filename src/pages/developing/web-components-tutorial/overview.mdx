## Prerequisites

### Carbon Web Components

This is a web development tutorial that uses Carbon Web Components. If you're just getting started with Web Components and would like to learn the preliminaries by doing, check out the Google Developer Web Fundamentals on [web components](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/web-components).

### ES6/ES2015

While Carbon for IBM.com is also available via <Link to="/developing/frameworks/web-components#install-via-cdn">CDN</Link>, this tutorial uses the ES6/ES2015 approach for building an application using Carbon for IBM.com Web Components. You'll want to be up to speed on the most commonly used features of the language. [Let's Learn ES6](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL57atfCFqj2h5fpdZD-doGEIs0NZxeJTX) covers those features in depth.

### GitHub

We'll be using GitHub to build an app together, so if you're new to GitHub, make
sure you've [made an account](https://github.com/join). Their
[getting started guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world) is a
great way to learn GitHub.

### Yarn

This tutorial uses [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) for dependency management so we
can take advantage of offline installs. Make sure that you have
[Yarn installed](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) prior to starting the
tutorial so you can follow along step-by-step.

## Outline

Each step in this tutorial illustrates a different aspect of developing web
applications with Carbon. We recommend starting with step 1, but you can pick up
any step and take it from there.

1. [**Installing Carbon for IBM.com**](/developing/web-components-tutorial/step-1)
   - Create a web app with the dotcom shell component.
2. [**Adding out of the box components**](/developing/web-components-tutorial/step-2)
   - Incorporate a few components into your new page.
3. [**Adding custom Content block components**](/developing/web-components-tutorial/step-3)
   - Organize your content into different blocks.
4. [**Adding custom Carbon components**](/developing/web-components-tutorial/step-4)
   - Build custom interactable experiences with Carbon components.
5. [**Deploying to GitHub Pages**](/developing/web-components-tutorial/step-5)
   - Bring your page out into the world.
