## Fork, clone and branch

This tutorial has an accompanying GitHub repository called
[carbon-for-ibm-dotcom-tutorial](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-for-ibm-dotcom-tutorial)
that we'll use as a starting point for each step. If you haven't forked and
cloned that repository yet, and haven't added the upstream remote, go ahead and
do so by following the <Link to="/developing/web-components-tutorial">step 1
instructions</Link>.

### Branch

With your repository all set up, let's check out the branch for this tutorial
step's starting point.

```bash
git fetch upstream
git checkout -b web-components-step-2 upstream/web-components-step-2
```

<InlineNotification>

**Note:** This builds on top of step 1, but be sure to check out the upstream
step 2 branch because it includes the static assets required to get through this
step.

## Submit pull request

We're going to submit a pull request to verify completion of this tutorial step.

### Continuous integration (CI) check

Run the CI check to make sure we're all set to submit a pull request.

```bash
yarn ci-check
```

### Git commit and push

Before we can create a pull request, stage and commit all of your changes:

```bash
git add --all && git commit -m "feat(tutorial): complete step 2"
```

Then, push to your repository:

```bash
git push origin web-components-step-2
```

### Pull request (PR)

Finally, visit
[carbon-for-ibm-dotcom-tutorial](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-for-ibm-dotcom-tutorial)
to "Compare & pull request". In doing so, make sure that you are comparing to
`web-components-step-2` into `base: web-components-step-2`.

<InlineNotification>

**Note:** Expect your tutorial step PRs to be reviewed by the Carbon for IBM.com
team but not merged. We'll close your PR so we can keep the repository's remote
branches pristine and ready for the next person!

<InlineNotification>

**Note:** If your PR fails the Github Actions test with the error
`Can't make a request in offline mode`, try running the following command:
`rm -rf .yarn-offline-mirror node_modules && yarn cache clean && yarn install`.
Add and commit the changes once this completes, and try pushing again.
