## Types

A CTA type defines the function of a given CTA to best inform the user what action to take.

| Type | Icon | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|
|_Jump_|ICON|The jump link uses the down arrow to indicate to the user this link jumps down the page.|
|_Local_|ICON|The local link is mainly used to navigate a user to another destination within IBM.com.|
|_External_|ICON|The external link uses the launch icon to indicate that this link leaves the current page, and opens within a new tab.|
|_Video_|ICON|The video type CTA pulls metadata from Kaltura to populate the link’s content, and launches within the LightboxMediaViewer.|


## Styles

A CTA style defines the look of a given CTA to best express what action will occur when the user interacts with it.


### Text

The default Text CTA style is a textual link with an icon. This type of CTA can be used at low levels within the page hierarchy. See <a href="https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/link/usage" target="_blank">Link</a> usage guideline on the Carbon Design System website to learn more.

### Feature

The feature CTA type is a larger version of [Card](https://www.ibm.com/standards/web/carbon-for-ibm-dotcom/components/card) with an image and group title to really emphasize a specific call to action. It should only be used once within a [Content block](https://www.ibm.com/standards/web/carbon-for-ibm-dotcom/components/content-block-simple). See the Feature card — block page to learn more about [Feature card block — medium](https://www.ibm.com/standards/web/carbon-for-ibm-dotcom/components/feature-card-block#feature-card-block-medium).
