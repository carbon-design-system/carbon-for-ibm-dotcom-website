## Overview

The Horizontal rule provides thematic breaks or divisions between content. Its primary role is to visually separate content and create clear distinctions between sections of a web page. It can also be used as a graphical element to add structure or delineate pieces of information.

## Modifiers

### Type

Horizontal rule has two type options: Solid or Dashed. If the type is set to Solid, the rule will will display as one continues stroke. If the type is set to Dashed, the horizontal rule will display with short strokes with breaks inbetween.

Note that the Solid type is used much more in Carbon for IBM.com components.

### Size

Horizontal rule has two main size options: Fixed or Fluid. If the size is set to Fixed, the length of the horizontal rule does not change based on browser size, and there are several fixed sizes to choose from. If the size is set to Fluid, the horizontal rule will resize autmatically as the window size changes. The overhang and inset are the two main styles for this variation.

Note that the Fluid size is used much more in Carbon for IBM.com components.
