## Default
The Table of Contents (ToC) component renders as left navigation that includes anchor links to various locations on the page. The links themselves can either be dynamically generated based on anchor links and associated title attributes or manually entered by the author to be different from the content on the page.

<Row>
<Column colMd={8} colLg={8}>

**When to use:**
* When the page length is long and requires a lot of scrolling.
* When users need to know what is included in a page, the table of contents can serve as an outline or summary of the page content.
* When users need to navigate to a specific section on the page quickly.

**When not to use:**
* When a page is relatively short and the user will not have to scroll very far.
* When users need to read all the content in a specific order.

## Variations

### Vertical with heading content
This variation only applies to the vertical Table of Contents (ToC). The area above the Table of contents can be utilized in many waysâ€”showing navigational links, the page title, or an image.

<Row>
<Column colMd={8} colLg={8}>

### Horizontal
The horizontal variation lays the table of content navigation links into a row. When present, it sticks to the top of the page while scrolling. It then replaces the masthead sticky navigation when the top of its container meets the top of the window.

**When to use:**

* Your experience needs to use full width section components or the first 4 columns of the 2x grid.
* The table of contents needs to be used across alternating full width themed sections throughout a page.

**When not to use:**

* The horizontal version should not be used with a center aligned lead space because the text alignment disrupts the users reading flow, consider using the vertical version with Lead space centered or Lead space block.
