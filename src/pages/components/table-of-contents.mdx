## Default
The Table of Contents (ToC) component renders as left navigation that includes anchor links to various locations on the page. The links themselves can either be dynamically generated based on anchor links and associated title attributes or manually entered by the author to be different from the content on the page.

**When to use:**
* When users need to know what is included in a page, mainly when it contains a log of information. It serves as an outline or summary of the page content.
* When users need to rely on scrolling to consume the information on the page.
* When users need to navigate to a specific section on the page quickly.

**When not to use:**
* When users do not need to relaying on scrolling to find the content they need.
