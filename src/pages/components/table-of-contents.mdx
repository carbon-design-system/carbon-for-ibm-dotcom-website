## Overview

The Table of contents (ToC) component renders as left navigation that includes anchor links to various locations on the page. The links themselves can either be dynamically generated based on anchor links and associated title attributes or manually entered by the author.

**When to use:**

- When the page length is long and requires a lot of scrolling.
- When users need to know what is included in a page, the table of contents can serve as an outline or summary of the page content.
- When users need to navigate to a specific section on the page quickly.

**When not to use:**

- When there is only one section, there is no need to include the ToC
- When a page is relatively short and the user will not have to scroll very far.
- When users need to read all the content in a specific order.

## Variations

### Horizontal

The horizontal variation displays the Table of content navigation links in a row. When present, it sticks to the top of the page while scrolling. It then replaces the masthead sticky navigation when the top of its container meets the top of the window.

**When to use:**

- Your experience needs to use full width section components or the first 4 columns of the 2x grid.
- The table of contents needs to be used across alternating full width themed sections throughout a page.

**When not to use:**

- The horizontal version should not be used with a center aligned lead space because the text alignment disrupts the user's reading flow. In that situation, consider using the vertical version with Lead space centered or Lead space block.
- The horizontal version should not be placed immediately below the IBM masthead.

## Modifiers

### Vertical with heading content

This variation only applies to the vertical Table of Contents (ToC). The area above the Table of contents can be utilized in many ways—showing navigational links, the page title, or an image.

## Behaviors

### Sticky behavior

The Table of contents is sticky to provide context to the user about where they are within a given page.

#### Larger breakpoints (lg, xl, and max)

- The default or vertical ToC is sticky within the first four columns on lg. xlg, and max breakpoints.
- The horizontal ToC sticks to the top of the page and pushes the Masthead out of view on the lg, xlg and max breakpoints.

#### Smaller breakpoints (sm and med)

Both vertical and horizontal versions of the ToC change to a dropdown on md and sm breakpoints. The dropdown sticks to the top of the page and pushes the Masthead out of view. When the user scrolls up the Masthead re-appears and pushes the ToC down.

## Tips and techniques

### Number of ToC items

We recommend having a maximum of seven items in the vertical Table of contents. When there are too many ToC items, the component can become taller than the screen height, resulting in a double scroll for users and disrupting the sticky behavior.

The ToC should never extend more than the screen height so that it can be effective as a sticky element.

### Labels

The Table of contents labels should inform users what information they will find within a given section of a page.

Table of contents labels and the page headers they link to should be the same or a shortened version of the page header to establish a clear relationship between the ToC and the corresponding page section, see some of the example images below.

#### Default

The default ToC can accommodate multi-line labels, and therefore can generally match the page header.

1. ToC label
2. Content block header

#### Horizontal

The horizontal ToC is best suited for simple one to two word labels that are shortened versions of the page header. The horizontal ToC is typically used in conjunction with [Content section](https://www.ibm.com/standards/carbon/components/content-section) components that render a header in the first four left columns, allowing for a more descriptive [Content block](https://www.ibm.com/standards/carbon/components/content-block) headline.
