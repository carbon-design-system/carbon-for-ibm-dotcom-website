**Note:** In v2, lead space search no longer supports a media background to ensure the space remains accessible across breakpoints. The adjacent theme modifier has also been simplified for implementation.

## Overview

Lead space search includes a heading, an optional subheading, and a Carbon [search](https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/search/usage/) field. This version of the lead space is especially useful when the page displays many options that a user could be interested in.

### When to use

The search field is one of the most frequently used design elements in a content-heavy web experience. To be effective, the search should be displayed at the top of the page content as it can be the fastest route to information discovery. Finding information quickly is essential for reducing bounce rate, extending the time users spend on the page, and can motivating them to take action.

Use lead space search when the page displays multiple items and users need an efficient way to find items relevant to them. Lead space search is an excellent choice for content-heavy pages and knowledge base experiences. It can be used together with the [filter panel](../components/filter-panel) component for even greater discoverability.

### When not to use

If you are not building a content-heavy page, a knowledge base experience, or if you do not need to display a great number of products or services, with categories and other classification criteria, you should consider using another lead space component such as [lead space](../components/leadspace) or [lead space block](../components/lead-space-block).

Lead space search has a contextual, local search, and is not used for global search. If you need a global search option, you can find it in the [masthead](../components/masthead).

1. **Heading:** Customizable heading for the lead space search component.
2. **Subheading:** Optional supporting copy under the heading.
3. **Search:** Search field component displayed prominently.

## Modifiers

### Adjacent theme

Lead space search provides the option to display the heading and subheading container as one theme, and the search field as an adjacent theme. When enabled, the search field container will automatically adopt the adjacent theme which pairs with the theme in the heading and subheading container.

This is useful when you wish to visually separate the two containers while more closely associating the search with the results visualized on the page.

</Column>

</Row>

### Heading highlight

Like other lead spaces, lead space search's heading can be modified to highlight a word or phrase. This can be used to highlight product names, industries, or particular value. The highlighted word or phrase can be anywhere in the heading, but it should only ever appear once in a single lead space. This only applies to the heading, and does not extend to any other lead space search element.

Keep in mind that the highlight is meant to only apply to an important word or phrase. The highlight should not cover the entire heading, and should only highlight one word or phrase.

## Behaviors

### Scrolling behavior

Lead space search can scroll with the page, or it can be configured to adopt an optional sticky behavior for the search component and its container.

The sticky behavior ensures that the search field is always present as the user scrolls down the page. The masthead is pushed out of view and a customized heading can appear in the sticky search container for additional context.

Note that if the table of contents component is present, the lead space search sticky option will become inactive.

### Desktop breakpoints

The search component spans 8 columns of the 16 column grid.

#### Keyboard interaction

Lead space search includes a `skip to main content` option for keyboard users so they can jump into the main content and/or search results.

### Mobile breakpoints

The search component spans 6 columns of the grid for the `md` breakpoint and 4 columns of the grid for the `sm` breakpoint.

The component can scroll with the page, or adopt a sticky behaviour for the search container. Unlike desktop, there is no option to display a sticky heading along with the search component, because the search field takes up the maximum number of columns.
