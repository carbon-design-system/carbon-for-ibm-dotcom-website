  Content section is a high-level content component that acts as the main content unit to build web page experiences for

  them together, providing flexibility to create many different solutions for users.

## Overview

The Content section component can be used and customized for different types of web page experiences, boosting
productivity by not having to recreate it every time. Because it is naturally decoupled from the Dotcom shell, it can be
used multiple times on a web page, acting as the main structural content unit.

1. **Heading:** A customizable heading for the Content section.
2. **Description:** A short description.
3. **CTA text link or CTA card link:** Use this as a general call to action at the Content section level.
4. **Child container:** Use this to insert other high-level content units, like content blocks and content groups.

#### When to use

Use Content section when you need to organize a web page experience into main content units. One of the advantages of
Content section is that it can take a different color theme from the page theme. Use this option carefully to avoid an
unwanted page banding experience. Page banding happens when contrasting full-width backgrounds are alternating on a
page, interrupting the reading experience for the user.

#### When not to use

Do not use a Content section to separate only content items, or other related basic content items (like paragraphs)
inside a web page. Use a [Content group](https://www.ibm.com/standards/carbon/components/content-group) instead.

## Behaviors

The Content section elements are persistent throughout the online experience. It is fully responsive and changes how
elements are displayed based on the browser size.

#### Desktop breakpoints

If the browser is wider than the max breakpoint of 1584px, the Content section and all other page content will center
and extra margin will appear on either side of the page layout. The Content section heading, description and link CTA
will take the first four (out of 16) columns of the grid, while the children container will take the other 12 columns.

#### Mobile breakpoints

At medium and small breakpoints, the Content section will add a significant change: the child container will move above
the CTA text link. See the image below.

[Content block simple](https://www.ibm.com/standards/carbon/components/content-block-simple), or a
[Content block cards](https://www.ibm.com/standards/carbon/components/content-block-cards), both ready-to-use
components.

## Tips and techniques

The Content section elements are persistent throughout the online experience. It is fully responsive and changes how
elements are displayed based on the browser size.

It's important to keep in mind that on medium and small breakpoints, the child container is positioned between the
Content section description and the CTA text link.

Each type of content unit (content section, content block, content group or content item, and their many options) will
usually have a certain type of CTA as the last element in the component architecture.

Try to avoid CTA stacking at the end of a Content section. If multiple CTAs are present, use different types. For
example, a card link from a Content block and a CTA text link as the final element of the Content section.
