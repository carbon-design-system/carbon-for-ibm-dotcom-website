<InlineNotification>

**Breaking change:** Previously, tabs extended was a separate component in Carbon for IBM.com v1. In v2, tabs extended will use Carbon Design System's [tab](https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/tabs/usage/) directly with automatic style updates.

## Overview

Tabs extended displays parallel pieces of related content, allowing users to explore the displayed content of their choice. It also has the benefit of reducing the amount of scrolling the user may have to do on a given page, but should be used carefully because some information is hidden on load. If the information within a tab is essential for the user, consider using a different component that will not hide the content.

The tabs extended component uses the Carbon Design System's [tabs](https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/tabs/usage/) component directly, and includes automatic style updates to optimize for editorial content.

#### Tab labels

Like tabs, each tab label is set to auto-width and will vary based on the label's character count, and will have consistent padding on either side of the label. Keep this in mind as you write labels for each tab, as overly long labels can push other options out of the initial view. Also consider that translation will generally lengthen the label, reference the [content guidance table](### content-guidance-for-tabs-extended) for best practices.

Tabs extended can nest other components inside its content area to display them based on the user's selection. We recommend nesting similar components in sequence, rather than varying the types of components displayed in a given tabs experience.

## Behaviors

### Overflow

When the tabs extended options would be hidden due to the window becoming too small, overflow buttons will automatically appear on the sides of the component. These buttons allow users to navigate the entire tabs extended to see all options regardless of screen size. Note that this functionality occurs across all breakpoints, not just mobile.
