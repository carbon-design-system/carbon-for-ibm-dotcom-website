## Default
The default Card is a simple text-based card. It includes a main title, optional eyebrow, body copy, and CTA (call-to-action). The Card can be used to create other card-based components such as [Content group — with cards](https://www.ibm.com/standards/web/carbon-for-ibm-dotcom/patterns/content-group-with-cards) and [Card section.](https://www.ibm.com/standards/web/carbon-for-ibm-dotcom/patterns/card-section)
