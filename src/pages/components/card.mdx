## Default
The Card is the work horse of many page types. The default Card includes a heading, optional eyebrow, optional copy, optional media, and CTA (call-to-action). By adding and removing optional content, Card can appear as a wide variety of designs. Card can be used to create other card-based components such as [Content group cards](https://www.ibm.com/standards/carbon/components/content-group-cards) and [Card section](https://www.ibm.com/standards/carbon/components/card-section).

## Variations

### With pictogram

Card with pictograms features a pictogram element. It can improve the user experience when paired with content that has common visual associations. In addition, pictograms provide a lot of visual interest and can improve the overall page. However, keep im mind meanings of pictograms can differ heavily across cultures, and should be used carefully.

Cards with pictogram allows for two pictogram positioning: top aligned or bottom aligned.

#### Bottom aligning pictogram

Bottom aligning pictogram ensures that the card heading is the first element read, which helps with messaging when it is not immediately deciferable from the pictogram.

When this card is set to have bottom aligned pictogram, it has the bonus feature of showing copy on hover. Keep in mind should you choose to have additional copy on hover, the pictogram will be hidden on mobile in order to keep the copy visible.

#### Top aligning pictogram

Top aligning pictogram should only be used when the pictogram is strongly and precisely associated with the card heading. For example, an airplane for "Aerospace and defence".
