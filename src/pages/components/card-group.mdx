## Modifiers

Card group allows the following properties to be modified to achieve a wide range of designs.

### Cards per row

Cards per row dictates the number of cards in a row. Sometimes this can be adjusted based on total card number or breakpoint to avoid orphaning single card in the last row.

### Offset

Offset adds empty card slots to the beginning of the group, and can be used to achieve L shape card gropus.
