## Overview

Card group by default arranges cards on a collapsed grid, and applies a 1px border between neighboring cards. An optional CTA card in an inverse theme can be added for visual impact. Only one CTA card is allowed per group.

## Variations

### Card group with card in card

Card in card can be used with the card group component to give focus to the first card.

<Column colMd={8} colLg={8}>

## Modifiers

Card group allows the following properties to be modified to achieve a wide range of designs.

### Cards per row

Cards per row dictates the number of cards in a row. Sometimes this can be adjusted based on total card number or breakpoint to avoid orphaning single card in the last row.

<Caption>
  To avoid having a single card on a row (as shown in the left image), you
  change change the cards per row setting from 3 to 2, to achieve a 2x2
  configuration (as shown in the right image).

### Offset

Offset adds empty card slots to the beginning of the group, and can be used to achieve L shape card groups.
