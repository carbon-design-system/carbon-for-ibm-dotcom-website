## Overview

Universal banner is intended for high level and critical announcements such as IBM's THINK global event or COVID-19 messaging. The banner is the only component that can be positioned above the masthead. It has a max height to encourage succinct messaging and optional fields for an image, heading, body copy, and CTA.

For non-critical announcements and callouts, use the [Content group banner](https://www.ibm.com/standards/carbon/components/content-group-banner/) component instead.

1. **Image:** Optional image with two size options.
2. **Heading:** A succinct and optional heading about the announcement.
3. **Body copy:** A short optional description.
4. **CTA type:** The optional call to action for the user.

## Behaviors

Note that if the content extends beyond the component's fixed height, the content will be cut off.

### Small breakpoint (sm)

The Universal banner is presented differently at the small breakpoint.

- The image is hidden.
- The CTA changes from a button to a text link.
- The entire banner is clickable.

## Modifiers

### Images

Universal banner accommodates two different image size options, one at 4 columns wide and another 8 columns wide for the large, x-large, and max breakpoints.
