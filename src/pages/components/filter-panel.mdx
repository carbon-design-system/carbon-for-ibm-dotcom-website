## Selection methods
Choosing the right filter selection method will improve usability and user efficiency. Filter panel supports several selection methods that are appropriate for different situations. Consider the data your users are looking at, what they are trying to achieve, and how they might intuitively narrow down the data.

### Single selection
Use a single-selection filter when the user can pick only one attribute to modify data results. Under the hood, single selection behaves like a radio button.

</Row>


Single-selection supports multiple tiers of content. Second tier content is exposed after the user selects the parent filter, tiered content is indented below the parent filter.

</DoDont>
</DoDontRow>

### Multiselect
Use a multiselect filter when the user has the option to pick more than one attribute to modify the data results. Under the hood, multiselects behave like checkboxes.

### Multiple categories
A category is a set of filter items within the same topic. For example, “size” is a category and small, medium, large, and extra large are its filter choices. Multiple filter categories may be applied to the same data set. For example, the user can filter by size, color, and price range.

## Behaviors

### Larger breakpoints (max, xl, lg)
The filter panel spans 4 columns of the 16 column grid with a customizable height. It can be configured with any number of filters and categories. 

* The user may expand multiple filter categories at a time.
* The user may collapse all categories.
* The user can collapse categories that have filters selected. 

### Scroll
Filter panel scrolls with the page. Depending on the amount of filters available to the user, the filter panel could exceed the browser height.

### Keyboard interaction
Filter panel includes a Skip to main content option for keyboard users so they can jump into the main content and/or search results.

### Smaller breakpoints (md and sm)
On smaller breakpoints, the filter panel is triggered by a button that can be configured anywhere within the experience. Once the user selects the filter button, a modal will open and display the filter panel, the user can close the modal to view the filtered results. The filter button should indicate how many filters the user has selected.

## Category guidance

When determining the default display for your user, consider the information you have in your filter, including:

* The ordering of categories
* The number of categories
* The number of items within each category

Then decide which categories are open by default and which categories are closed. Try to strike a balance between what the user may need and the cognitive load of seeing all options at once.

### Ordering of categories and items
The ordering of top level categories is usually determined by relevance to user goals.

Within the categories, we recommend the default ordering of items to be alphabetical unless business goals require a different ordering.

### Number of categories

#### One category
If there is only one category, consider displaying all the filters open.

*placeholder image*

#### Two to nine categories
If there are between two and nine categories of filters, consider having the top one to three categories open by default, and the other categories collapsed.

*placeholder image*

#### Ten or more categories
If there are over ten categories, consider collapsing all of the categories on initial load, or having the first category open.

*placeholder image*

### Number of filter items within a category

#### One to seven filter items
If there are between one and seven filter items within a category, expose all of the items.

*placeholder image*

#### Eight or more filter items
If there are eight or more filter items within a given category, consider utilizing the “View all” button. Expose a portion of the filter items so the user can quickly scan the options, once they select the view all button, the rest of the items are revealed.
