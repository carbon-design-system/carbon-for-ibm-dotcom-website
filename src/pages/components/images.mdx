## Overview

Opening TBD

<Row>
<Column  colLg={8} colMd={8} colSm={4}>

Image, at its core, is a wrapper that adds an image to the page. You have the option to pass multiple images to the
image component to render at the various breakpoints. This is particularly useful if you want to render different images
at different screen sizes.

We recommend displaying images at 1:1, 2:1, 3:2, 4:3, and 16:9 aspect ratios. For guidance on choosing or creating imagery,
see the IBM Design Language [photography guidelines](https://www.ibm.com/design/language/photography/overview).

**IBM Web Standards**

When using media on a page, refer to
[Use of images](https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/ibm-web-standards-external/standards-mandatory/page-layout-design) in the
IBM Web Standards for all type, format, size, and other requirements.

## Modifiers

### Border

A light gray border can be added to the Image component to help frame images. This is useful when the page
background and image background are the same or similar colors.

</Column>
</Row>

### Caption

If an image would benefit from additional context, a caption can be added immediately beneath the media. Captions paired with imagery are useful in editorial experiences where the image cannot appear on its own or needs additional information.

<Column colMd={8} colLg={8}>

The caption underneath reads "A rendering of the first IBM Quantum System One on a university campus being installed at RPI."](../../images/component/image/image-modifier-caption.png)

</Row>

### Lightbox

The Lightbox property of an image enables users to click or tap on the image to display a larger version of the image inside a [Lightbox media viewer](https://www.ibm.com/standards/carbon/components/lightbox-media-viewer) overlay. If this option is enabled, a button will appear at the bottom corner of the image and the entire media will be clickable.

Inside the overlay, the caption becomes the heading and there is an opportunity for additional body copy. Lightbox is useful if the user would benefit from exploring more about the image itself, including the additional copy.

If both a border and Lightbox are enabled on a particular image, the Lightbox border will be displayed instead of the lighter border property. If Lightbox is enabled, the cursor will change to `zoom-in` mode while hovering to reinforce the click interaction.

</Row>

#### Contrast

Lightbox has two contrast settings: light-contrast and dark-contrast. Either can be chosen to create appropriate contrast between the background media and the lightbox button. These contrast options are not tied to theme, rather they are selected based on the background media.

Note that the border is effected by the Carbon theme, but the Lightbox contrast setting is independent and chosen by the adopter based on the imagery needs.
