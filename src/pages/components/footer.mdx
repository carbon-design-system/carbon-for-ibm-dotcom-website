<PageDescription>

The footer is a section that sites at the bottom of any IBM.com page, and acts as the catch–all section that helps users navigate, provides corporate level general and legal informations. The footer is required on all pages on IBM.com.

There are two different footer. All pages are required to use the default footer, with the exception of a few pages that need to minimize distraction, such as checkout process. Please contact us if you think your page needs approval to use the minimal footer.
