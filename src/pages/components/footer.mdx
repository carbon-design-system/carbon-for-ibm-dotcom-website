### Default
The default footer is automatically generated based on the country and language code that you set on your page in the metadata. 

### Minimal
The Minimal footer is used when screen real estate is limited. 

## Rules
* Never customize the footer. 
* The footer contains high-level corporate links that can vary by geographical location and may change periodically. 
* Use the Template Generator or a content management tool to generate the footer HTML with the proper country and language links.
