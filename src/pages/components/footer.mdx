#### Max breakpoint

If the browser is wider than the max breakpoint of 1584px, the default footer and all other page content will center and extra margin will appear on either side of the page layout.

#### Md and sm breakpoints

At medium breakpoint, the default Footer will add a significant change: the Locale selector will move above the link groups and below the IBM logo.
Also, for the small breakpoint, besides the Locale selector new placement, the link groups become an accordion. See the image below.
