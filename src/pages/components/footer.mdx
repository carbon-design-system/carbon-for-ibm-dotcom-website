## Behavior


### Default
  
  
Default footer spans the full width of the viewport and is the last element in the browser window. The footer elements are persistent throughout the online experience. It is fully responsive and changes how elements are displayed based on the browser size.
 
  
  
#### Max breakpoint
If the browser is wider than the max breakpoint of 1584px, the default footer and all other page content will center and extra margin will appear on either side of the page layout.

#### Md and sm breakpoints
At medium breakpoint, the default Footer will add a significant change: the Locale selector will move above the link groups and below the IBM logo.
Also, for the small breakpoint, besides the Locale selector new placement, the link groups become an accordion. See the image below.
