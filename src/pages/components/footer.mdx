<PageDescription>

Footer is a section that sits at the bottom of any IBM.com page, and acts as the catch&mdash;all section that helps users navigate and provides corporate level general and legal information. The Footer is required on all pages on IBM.com.

There are two different Footers. All pages are required to use the default Footer, with the exception of a few pages that need to minimize distraction, such as checkout process. Please [contact us](https://cognitive-app.slack.com/archives/C2PLX8GQ6) if you think your page needs approval to use the minimal Footer.

## Default Footer
Default footer includes all high-level corporate navigation, required legal links, locale selector and branding. This footer is automatically generated based on the country and language code that you set on your page in the metadata.

## Minimal Footer
Minimal footer removes all high-level corporate navigation, leaving the required legal links, locale selector and branding. This is reserved for approved transactional pages only, such as check out and registration experiences. All other IBM.com pages should use the default footer.

## Micro Footer
This version only shows the legal links, which are required, and the optional locale selector to maximize the space for the content of the given page. This footer is reserved for stand-alone experiences such as product demos, or slide shows. All other pages and experiences on IBM.com should use the default or the minimal versions.

_This version is still in development._
