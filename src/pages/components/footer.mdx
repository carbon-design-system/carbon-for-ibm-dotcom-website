<PageDescription>

The footer is a section that sits at the bottom of any IBM.com page, and acts as a catchâ€“all section that helps users navigate, and provides corporate level informations. The footer is required for all pages on IBM.com.

There are two different footers. All pages are required to use the default footer, with the exception of a few approved pages that need to minimize distraction, such as checkout or registration process. Please [contact us](https://cognitive-app.slack.com/archives/C2PLX8GQ6) if you think your page needs to use the minimal footer.

## Default Footer

The default footer includes corporate level navigation to help users navigate, in additional to links to legal contents. The default footer content is automatically generated based on the country and language code that you set on your page in the metadata.

## Minimal Footer

Minimal footer variant reduces distraction by removing the corporate level navgitaion links and only showing the required legal links.

## Rules
<br/>

* Never customize the footer. 
* The footer contains high-level corporate links that can vary by geographical location and may change periodically. 
* Use the Template Generator or a content management tool to generate the footer HTML with the proper country and language links.
