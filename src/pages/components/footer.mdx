## Overview

The Footer is a required component on all IBM.com pages. There are three sizes available: [default](#default), [short](#short) and [micro](#micro), and each size has a specific use case. The Footer includes the IBM logo, navigational links, locale selector and required legal links.

The footer is generated automatically based on the country and language code that is set on the page in the metadata.

1. **IBM logo:** Links to the IBM homepage and is a required piece of the footer. The IBM logo should not be altered.
1. **Link group heading:** The link group heading is present for all the link groups.
1. **Link:** The default footer links are carefuly considered from the main navigation level and should not be changed.
1. **Locale selector:** Use the locale selector to trigger the locale modal component to allow users to change geographic regions and languages, if available.
1. **Legal links:** The general legal links are present on every IBM footer and cannot be changed.
1. **Adjunct legal link(s)** \*optional: Use up to two adjunct legal links for legally required notes or messages legally required to provide, regarding changes, policies or trademark issues.

### Behavior

Default footer spans the full width of the viewport and is the last element in the browser window. The footer elements are persistent throughout the online experience. It is fully responsive and changes how elements are displayed based on the browser size.

#### Max breakpoint

If the browser is wider than the max breakpoint of 1584px, the default footer and all other page content will center and extra margin will appear on either side of the page layout.

#### Md and sm breakpoints

At the medium breakpoint the Locale selector moves above the link groups and below the IBM logo. Additionally, at the small breakpoint the link groups are nested into accordions. See the image below.

#### When to use

Short footer is reserved for approved transactional pages, such as check out and registration experiences.

## Modifiers

### Theme

As a mandatory component of the IBM.com web experience, the footer should remain consistent, creating a branded anchor across all pages. The footer is only available in the gray 90 theme to maintain consistency across all pages.

### Locale or language selector

All footer sizes have the option to choose between using the locale selector or language selector.

#### Locale selector

The footer defaults to the locale selector, which displays the country and language of a given page within a button. It allows the user to change their locale through the [locale modal](https://www.ibm.com/standards/carbon/components/localemodal) by selecting the desired region, followed by the desired language.

<Row>

<Column colMd={4} colLg={6}>

![A visual example of the Locale selector](../../images/component/footer/footer--modifier-locale.png)

<Caption>The locale selector, displaying United States â€“ English.</Caption>

</Column>

</Row>

#### Language selector

The [language selector](https://www.ibm.com/standards/carbon/components/language-selector) displays only the language of a given page. It uses a combo box, and allows the user to select a language from the list or type in their desired language.

<Row>

<Column colMd={4} colLg={6}>

### Adjunct legal links

Only the default and the short footers may contain up to 2 adjunct legal links for legally required notes or messages. They are displayed at the very bottom of the page, under the main legal links.

#### When to use

Use up to two adjunct legal links for legally required notes or messages legally required to provide, regarding changes, policies or trademark issues.

An adjunct legal link will open a web page or a modale window with detailed changes to policies or trademark issues.

#### When not to use

Do not use an adjunct legal link to write footnotes or content-related notices. Include only links with basic text; do not include imagery or special formatting.

## Content guidance
