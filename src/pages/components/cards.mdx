## Overview

Cards present content with calls to action in a concise yet engaging style. [Card](#card) is often used to navigate users to information-rich articles. [Card link](#card-link) is presented within the context of other content and provides a path to more information about the subject. [Card in card](#card-in-card) provides a rich image option, with an inset card providing the call to action for more information. [Feature card](#feature-card) highlights a piece of content on the page, and should be used sparingly.

## Card

The Card component can be used in many different page types. The default design includes a heading and a call to action, and optional extras include include an eyebrow, copy, and media. By adding and removing optional content, the card offers a wide range of design possibilities.

The Card component can also be used to create other card-based components such as [Content group cards](https://www.ibm.com/standards/carbon/components/content-group-cards) and [Card section](https://www.ibm.com/standards/carbon/components/card-section).

<Row>
<Column colMd={8} colLg={8}>

![Image of Card anatomy](../../images/component/card/card-options-card-anatomy.png)

</Column>
</Row>

1. **Heading:** Heading has the highest information hierarchy on a card, and should be succinct and descriptive.
2. **Tag:** Add categories or special callouts to each card.
3. **Body copy:** Optional body copy can be added for additional descriptions.
4. **CTA type:** When using an icon, the default is `ArrowRight`.
5. **Media:** Can be an image or a video.
6. **Eyebrow:** Add additional context to the the heading.
7. **CTA link:** Can be used along with an icon to give more context.

For information about required and optional elements, see the [content guidance table](#content-guidance-for-card).

<Column colMd={8} colLg={8}>

### Modifiers

#### Pictogram

The card can also feature a pictogram element. [Pictograms](https://www.ibm.com/design/language/iconography/pictograms/library) provide a lot of visual interest and can enhance the overall look of the page. They can support the user experience when paired with content that has common visual associations. However, keep in mind that meanings of pictograms can differ heavily across cultures, and so they should be selected and used carefully. For information about content in pictogram cards, see the [content guidance table](#content-guidance-for-pictogram-card).

Cards with pictograms offer two pictogram positions: top-aligned or bottom-aligned.

<Row>
<Column colMd={8} colLg={8}>

![Image of Card component](../../images/component/card/card-pictogram.png)

<Caption>Left: Card with bottom-aligned pictogram. Right: Card with top-aligned pictogram.</Caption>

</Column>
</Row>

Bottom-aligning the pictogram ensures that the card heading is the first element the user reads. This helps when the message is not immediately decipherable from the pictogram.

An added bonus for the bottom-aligned pictogram is the feature of showing copy on hover. 

<Row>
<Column colMd={8} colLg={8}>

![Image of Card component](../../images/component/card/card-pictogram-motion.gif)

<Caption>Example of copy being shown on hover with bottom-aligned pictogram</Caption>

</Column>
</Row>

Top-aligning the pictogram should only be used when the pictogram is strongly and precisely associated with the card heading. For example, an airplane is the perfect choice for "Aerospace and defence", as shown in the above example. 

#### Static

By default, the entire Card is clickable with a single destination, but by adding the Static modifier you can add multiple links to a single card. This can be useful when you have multiple interactive elements on a single card that take the user to different pages. Static cards can appear with or without a border.

<Row>

<Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>

### Content guidance for Pictogram card
When a pictogram is added to a Card, the Card's appearance and content guidance changes.

## Card in card

Card in card shares the same functionality and text content requirements of a standard card, but requires a large media element. Card in card is often used in a [Card group](https://www.ibm.com/standards/carbon/components/card-group) to as a featured card.
