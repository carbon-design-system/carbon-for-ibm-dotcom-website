## Overview

The Card component is one of the main building blocks of IBM.com that can often be used to help users navigate to related information. There are various usages for Card, each with their own strengths and usage. Card can be used to navigate users to information-rich articles. Card link. is presented with other content as a jumping off point for more information. Card in card can put focus on images while using the card to provide more context. Feature card can highlight a piece of content on the page, and should be used sparingly.

## Card

The Card component is the workhorse for many different page types. The default design includes a heading and a CTA (call-to-action), and optional extras include include an eyebrow, copy, and media. By adding and removing optional content, the card has a wide range of design possibilities.

The card can also be used to create other card-based components such as [Content group cards](https://www.ibm.com/standards/carbon/components/content-group-cards) and [Card section](https://www.ibm.com/standards/carbon/components/card-section).

</Column>
</Row>

1. **Heading (required):** Customizable header for the Card link.
2. **Tag:** Add categories or special callouts to each card.
3. **Body copy (optional):** Can include body copy for additional context.
4. **CTA icon:** By default, uses `ArrowRight`.
5. **Media:** Can be an image or a video.
6. **Eyebrow:** Add additional context to the body copy.
7. **CTA link:** Can be used with CTA icon to give more context.

### Modifiers

#### Pictogram card

The card can also feature a pictogram element. Pictograms provide a lot of visual interest and can improve the overall look of the page. They can also support the user experience when paired with content that has common visual associations. However, keep in mind that meanings of pictograms can differ heavily across cultures, and so they should be selected and used carefully.

Cards with pictogram offers two pictogram positions: top-aligned or bottom-aligned.

<Row>
<Column colMd={8} colLg={8}>

![Image of Card component](../../images/component/card/card-pictogram.png)

<Caption>Left: Card with bottom-aligned pictogram. Right: Card with top-aligned pictogram.</Caption>

</Column>
</Row>

Bottom-aligning the pictogram ensures that the card heading is the first element read. This helps when the message is not immediately decipherable from the pictogram.

An added bonus for the bottom-aligned pictogram is the feature of showing copy on hover. One thing to note with this feature is that the pictogram is hidden on mobile in order to keep the copy visible.

<Row>
<Column colMd={8} colLg={8}>

![Image of Card component](../../images/component/card/card-pictogram-motion.gif)

<Caption>Example of copy being shown on hover with bottom-aligned pictogram</Caption>

</Column>
</Row>

Top-aligning the pictogram should only be used when the pictogram is strongly and precisely associated with the card heading. For example, an airplane is the perfect choice for "Aerospace and defence", as shown in the above example.

#### Static

While the entire default Card is clickable, the Static modifier makes it so only the text link is clickable on the card.

## Card link

Unlike Card, which can stand on its own, Card link should be part of a layout or other component - it should never appear on its own. Card links contain a heading, the CTA (call-to-action), an action icon within a tile, and optional body copy. The entire card is clickable.

## Card in card

Card in card shares the same functionality and text content requirements of a standard card, but requires a large media. Card in card is often used in a [Card group](https://www.ibm.com/standards/carbon/components/card-group) to as a featured card.
