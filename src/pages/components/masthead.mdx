## Masthead with Level 0
The Masthead with Level 0 (L0) refers to the first position of navigational menus on a page, it houses global elements and navigation labels. L is abbreviated for the "Level" starting at base 0, the Level refers to the hierarchy of the navigation on the page.

#### When to use
Masthead with level 0 is suitable for top level pages. Examples include the home page, Products, and Solutions page.

### Variations

#### Search open by default

The Search field can be set to be open by default, this variation is typically used on Search result pages.

![Masthead component level 0 search open image](../../images/component/masthead/masthead-l0-search-open-by-default.png)

#### When to use
The Masthead with Search open by default is most commonly used on Search results pages where the search querey is displayed within the open search field.

### Anatomy
![Masthead component level 0 anatomy image](../../images/component/masthead/masthead-l0-anatomy.png)

1. **IBM logo:** Links to the IBM homepage and is a required piece of the masthead. The IBM logo should not be altered.
2. **Navigation labels:** Navigation labels are set to the default IBM global navigation, these labels are short descriptors to inform the user what type of content they will find within the menu.
3. **Search:** The search icon is persistent throughout the web experience, the search icon triggers the search bar to open and supports the search services for IBM.com.
4. **Profile:** Links to a user's MyIBM profile where they can access their IBMid.
5. **Mega menu:** The mega menu supports the large portfolio of offerings IBM provides and allows users to quickly scan and navigate to the information they are looking for. 

### Behavior

The Masthead spans the full width of the viewport and is the topmost element in the browser window. Masthead elements are persistent throughout the online experience. 

- Masthead with L0 supports a maximum of 7 nav labels. 
- Supports search and profile services.
- The masthead navigation informs the user of their location at all levels.

The masthead is fully responsive and changes what is displayed based on the browser size.Once there is not enough space to accommodate Masthead with L0 navigation labels, an overflow carousel will appear to allow users to navigate through the navigation labels. At smaller breakpoints a hamburger menu will appear to house all navigation labels. 

For the product navigation pattern, please see the [Global header Pattern](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/global-header) page on the Carbon website for detail.

#### Max breakpoint
If the broswer is wider than the max breakpoint of 1584px, the masthead and all other page content will center and extra margin will appear on either side of the page layout.

#### Default
At most desktop widths all the pieces of the masthead should display per the default design.

![Masthead component level 0 default behavior image](../../images/component/masthead/masthead-l0-behavior-default.png)

#### Overflow carousel
Once there is not enough space to accommodate the Masthead with L0 navigation labels, an overflow carousel will appear to allow users to navigate through the navigation labels. The smallest browser size for the overflow carousel is 800px wide.

![Masthead component level 0 overflow carousel behavior image](../../images/component/masthead/masthead-l0-behavior-overflow-carousel.png)

#### Mobile
All navigation labels will collapse into a left panel hamburger menu on any browser size below 800px wide.

![Masthead component level 0 mobile behavior image](../../images/component/masthead/masthead-l0-behavior-mobile.png)

#### Scrolling
The masthead is sticky, when scrolling the Masthead with L0 sticks to the top of the browser. 

#### Mega menu
The mega menu spans the width of the browser and slides out from the Masthead with L0 on click. It closes when the user selects a link within the menu, clicks outside the menu or collapses the menu via the navigation label.
   
   
## Masthead with Level 1
When the Masthead with Level 1 (L1) is used there are no navigation labels within the Level 0. L1 refers to second position of navigation menu(s) on a page, and often offers navigation within an ecosystem of pages. A Masthead with L1 should include an ecosystem name, like Analytics, to help the user identify where they are within the website. 

![Masthead component level 1 image](../../images/component/masthead/masthead-l1.png)

#### When to use:
Masthead with Level 1 is used for pages that are determined to be an ecosystem and receive contextual navigation. Examples include Services landing page, Solution topic page, Brand family, Product family and Product pages.

### Anatomy

1. **IBM logo:** Links to the IBM homepage and is a required piece of the masthead. The IBM logo should not be altered.
2. **Search:** The search icon is persistent throughout the web experience, the search icon triggers the search bar to open and supports the search services for IBM.com.
3. **Profile:** Links to a user's MyIBM profile where they can access their IBMid.
4. **Ecosystem name:** Ecosystem names should have only one text and color treatment. The ecosystem name is specific and based on the offering, product, and category, it is a direct link back to the IBM product or sub-topic page. Never use a logo and/or image for the ecosystem name.
5. **Navigation labels:** Navigation labels are set to the default IBM global navigation, these labels are short descriptors to inform the user what type of content they will find in the menu or link.

### Behavior

The masthead spans the full width of the viewport and is the topmost element in the browser window. Masthead elements are persistent throughout the online experience. 

- Masthead with L0 contains the IBM logo, global search and profile services.
- Supports search and profile services.
- Masthead with L1 supports an ecosystem name and additional navigation labels. 
- The masthead navigation informs the user of their location at all levels.

The masthead is fully responsive and changes what is displayed based on the browser size.Once there is not enough space to accommodate Masthead with L1 navigation labels, an overflow carousel will appear to allow users to navigate through the navigation labels, you can see an example in the Behavior section. At smaller breakpoints a hamburger menu will appear to house all navigation labels.
