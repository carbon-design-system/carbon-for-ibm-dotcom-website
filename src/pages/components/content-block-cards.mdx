## Overview

The default version pairs the Content block heading and [card group](https://www.ibm.com/standards/carbon/components/card-group) component. Use when you need to introduce a card group as its own content block without a description.

Content block cards does not support body copy, if you need to set more context, consider using a content block with a nested card group.

## Variations

### With images

Content block cards can use images to help tell its story to the user. This is great for breaking up dense text, adding
a little visual flare, and creating instant recognition.

### With videos

Sometimes a video will support the pages' narrative, but should not be prominently featured. This variation can be used
to provide those types of videos from within the page without creating a distraction that leads them out of the
narrative.
