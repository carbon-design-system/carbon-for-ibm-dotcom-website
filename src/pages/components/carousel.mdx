## Design 

This layout component is commonly used when you have a large amount of similar content needed on a page, but you don’t want to increase the screen real estate. It includes a headline, cards, controls, an optional sub-copy, and an optional CTA text link.

## Anatomy

1. **Headline**: Heading copy for the carousel component and is required.
2. **Subheading**: Additional sub copy usually used to elaborates on the main headline above it and is optional.
3. **CTA text link**: Call to action text link for directing the user to an action based off the content in the carousel and is optional. 
4. **Cards**: The main content of the carousel lives in the cards. This card can be designed with any variations of the [Card](https://www.ibm.com/standards/web/carbon-for-ibm-dotcom/components/card) component.
5. **Controls**: Icon buttons and pagination provide navigational controls for browsing through the carousel. These are required in the carousel.

## Usage guidance

### When should I use the carousel?

* Use when you have multiple related content pieces but screen real estate is limited.
* Use when you have exploratory content that isn't necessary but helpful for the user.
* Use when you want to tease user with additional related content.

### When should I not use the carousel?
* Do not use when content frames are not related.
* Do not use when users need to consume all carousel content because most users won't view every slide.

### Content

*The recommended amount of content is a minimum of 5 cards and maximum of 15 cards to avoid excessive clicking for the user.
* Make sure content in the carousel is related.
* Do not add essential content to a carousel. Essential content could include navigational or wayfinding content links. 
* Prioritize the most important content at the beginning of the carousel.
* Carousel content should be simple and concise.
* Common content used in carousels includes use cases, news articles, client testimonials, and quotes. 
* Make sure carousel content can be accessed outside the carousel in a menu, footer, and navigational page.
