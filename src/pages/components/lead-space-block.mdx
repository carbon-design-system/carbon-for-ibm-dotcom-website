<PageDescription>

Lead space &mdash; block is an alternative to the [Lead space](https://www.ibm.com/standards/web/ibm-dotcom-library/patterns/leadspace), enabling a more productive first site of viewer engagement. 

The Lead space &mdash; block is positioned at the top of a web page, with a purpose to orient the user when they land on a page, inform them of the content, and guide them to the first key piece of content on the page, whether it’s a crucial piece of information or a call-to-action button.

## Default
When designed and implemented effectively, the Lead space &mdash; block can be used to engage visitors immediately in one of the most important moments in the user’s journey through a complex web environment.

It includes a headline, subheadline, supporting message, [Link list](https://ibmdotcom-react.mybluemix.net/?path=/story/components-linklist--default) and a call to action. There is also the option to add media in the form of an image or video.
