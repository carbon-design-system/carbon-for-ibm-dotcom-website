## Overview

The content block acts as the heading level two on pages after the lead space component and spans 12 columns of the 16 column grid. The content block is commonly used to divide the main categories or sections of the page to help guide the user through the content or narrative.

### Anatomy

![Anatomy image of the content block](../../images/component/content-block/content-block-anatomy.png)

1. **Content block heading:** An optional, customizable heading for the Content section.
2. **Sub heading:** An optional, customizable sub heading for the Content section.
3. **Copy:** An optional short description.
4. **Child container:** Insert additional components to enhance the narrative, such as content group, content item or card group.
5. **CTA:** Use this as a general call to action, typically used to encompass the entire content section.
6. **Border:** An optional bottom border.

### Usage

Content block is often paired with the [content section](../components/content-section) or the [vertical table of contents](../components/table-of-contents#vertical) to guide the user through the narrative and activate the first four columns of the 16 column grid.

## Modifiers


### Children

Similar to the content section, the content block can accept child components which allows designers and authors maximum flexibility when creating page layouts. The most common layouts on IBM.com are 8 column and 12 column components.

There is no limit to how many child components the content block can accept - consider the story you are trying to tell, the overall hierarchy of the page and how many content blocks should be used to break up the content. View the [gallery](#gallery) to see examples of content block with various child components.

#### 8 column child

In this example the content block is paired with a group of [content item pictograms](./content-item) that span the center 8 columns of the grid.

#### 12 column child

In this example the content block is paired with a [card group](./card-group) that spans 12 columns of the grid.

#### Mixing children widths

The content block can support mixing of various children and how many columns of the grid the children can span. Most of the Carbon for IBM.com components have been carefully designed with line length and column usage in mind, and therefore should fit within the columns without alteration.

In this example the content block spans 8 columns, but has a group of content items that span 12 columns of the grid.

## Behaviors

At smaller breakpoints, if content block is paired with a content section, the content section heading stacks on top of the content block heading.

<Column colMd={8} colLg={8}>

## Gallery

The content block is one of the main layout components for designing pages of the IBM.com platform. Here are some examples of various layouts you can create by utilizing the extreme flexibility the content block provides by utilizing the varying heading options and adding custom children.
