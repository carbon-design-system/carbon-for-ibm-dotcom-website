## Overview

The Content block component can be used and customized for different types of web experiences. It can be used multiple
times inside a Content section component, acting as a main content unit for it.

1. **Heading:** Customizable heading for the Content block component.
2. **Description:** A short optional description.
3. **Primary child container:** Use this to insert other high-level content units, such as Content groups.
4. **CTA:** Use this component as a general call to action at block level.
5. **Aside container:** This container is used only to insert aside elements, or a link list, for the Content block.

#### When to use

Use Content block when you need to organize a web page experience into high-level content units inside of a Content
section. One of the advantages of the block is that it is visually very prominent on the page, thanks to its large
heading and accompanying description. Use it inside a complex Content section to hierarchically separate different
content units for easier reading and comprehension.

#### When not to use

Do not look to Content blocks as a replacement for Content sections. A page is separated into sections, and then within
the sections there is further separation into blocks. Do not use a Content block to only separate content items, or
other related basic content units like paragraphs inside of a web page. Use a Content group instead.

## Behaviors

The Content block elements are persistent throughout the online experience. The component is fully responsive and the
display adjusts with different browser sizes.

#### Desktop breakpoints

If the browser is wider than the max breakpoint of 1584px, the Content block and all other page content will center and
the margins on either side of the page layout will increase. The Content block is recommended to take the last 12
columns of the 16-column grid. Within these 12 columns, the block heading, description, primary child container, and the
CTA will take the first 8 grid columns, and the aside will take the last 4 grid columns.

For particular editorial experiences where there is no aside, it is possible to lay out a Content block on 4 columns,
making the reading experience more story-like and engaging.

#### Mobile breakpoints

At medium and small breakpoints, the Content block will add a significant change: the primary child container will move
above the Content block CTA and the aside will move to the bottom of the Content block. See below.

### Examples

These examples showcase the versatility of Content block, showing first how it can include a Content group with aside
elements, alternating with a Content block containing a Card group of four cards.

## Tips and techniques

Content block elements are persistent throughout the online experience. It is fully responsive and changes how elements
are displayed based on the browser size.

Keep in mind that on medium and small breakpoints, the primary container is positioned between the Content block
description and the CTA text link.

Avoid CTA stacking at the end of a Content block. If possible, use different types.
