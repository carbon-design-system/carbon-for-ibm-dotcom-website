## Overview

The content block acts as the heading level two on pages after the lead space component and spans 12 columns of the 16 column grid. The content block is commonly used to divide the main categories or sections of the page to help guide the user through the content or narrative.

### Children

Similar to the content section, the content block can accept child components which allows designers and authors maximum flexibility when creating page layouts. The most common layouts on IBM.com are 8 column and 12 column components.

There is no limit to how many child components the content section can accept - consider the story you are trying to tell, the overall hierarchy of the page and how many content sections should be used to break up the content. View the [gallery](#gallery) to see examples of content section with various child components.

## Behaviors

The content section elements are persistent throughout the experience. It is fully responsive and changes how
elements are displayed based on the browser size, at tablet and mobile breakpoints the content section heading stacks on top of the content block heading.
