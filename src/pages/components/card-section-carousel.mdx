## Usage guidance

### When should I use the Card section carousel?

- Use when you have multiple related content pieces but screen real estate is limited.
- Use when you have exploratory content that isn't necessary but helpful for the user.
- Use when you want to tease user with additional related content.

### When should I not use the Card section carousel?

- Do not use when content frames are not related.
- Do not use when users need to consume all carousel content because most users won't view every slide.

### Content

- The recommended amount of content is a minimum of 5 cards and maximum of 15 cards to avoid excessive clicking for the user.
- Make sure content in the carousel is related.
- Do not add essential content to a carousel. Essential content could include navigational or wayfinding content links.
- Prioritize the most important content at the beginning of the carousel.
- Carousel content should be simple and concise.
- Common content used in carousels includes use cases, news articles, client testimonials, and quotes.
- Make sure carousel content can be accessed outside the carousel in a menu, footer, and navigational page.
