## Default

By default the Content block &mdash; with cards simply supports only text for moments needing richer content, and sets proper expectations for the user to make their next journey decision from within the page's narrative.

## Variations

### With images

Content block &mdash; with cards can use images to help tell its story to the user. This is great for breaking up dense text, adding a little visual flare, and creating instant recognition.

### With videos

Sometimes a video will support the pages' narrative, but should not be prominently featured. This variation can be used to provide those types of videos from within the page without creating a distraction that leads them out of the narrative.
