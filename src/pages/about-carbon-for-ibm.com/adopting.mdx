## Overview

Carbon for IBM.com is the strategic design system for IBM web experiences. Any application using older systems like Northstar (v18), v19, or even earlier versions should make plans to adopt Carbon for IBM.com by the end of 2021.

After all applications have migrated, plans and dates will be announced for sunsetting the older systems. Reach out to us in our IBM Slack channel at [#carbon-for-ibm-dotcom](https://ibm-studios.slack.com/archives/C2PLX8GQ6) with any questions.

## Choosing the right path to adoption

#### For Marketing

For pages produced and published in Marketing's Content Management System, Carbon will be made available through the creation of pages in AEM. The use of these templates when they become available is the path to Carbon because these templates are part of a new content model and publishing tool.

For more information, please visit internal link [Afterburner](https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/adobe).

In the interim, while these templates are being built, page owners can use the
Design Guidelines to configure existing pages to have the look and feel of IBM
Design Language.

[Marketing Platforms Drupal CMS website](https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/squad-pulse/marketing-platforms/drupal-cms#Links).

#### For websites or applications on v18 (Northstar), v19a, or other design systems

Make plans now to migrate your site to Carbon for IBM.com. This site explains
how to get started with Carbon for IBM.com. It provides links to the code
repository, the storybook, usage guidelines, and additional resources. Keep in
mind the following as you get started:

- The primary way of building experiences with Carbon and Carbon for IBM.com is
  using a modular approach with Node Package Manager (NPM). This would require a
  development re-architecture from prior design systems that are loaded over a
  Content Delivery Network (CDN). Applications that are built with this approach
  would require a module bundler in the application build process like
  [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/), [rollup](https://rollupjs.org/), or
  [parcel](https://parceljs.org/).

  An alternative to module bundling would be leveraging the CDN versions of <Link to="/developing/frameworks/web-components">Carbon for IBM.com Web Components</Link> and [Carbon Web Components](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/developing/frameworks/web-components/).

- Carbon has a new 2x grid so everything needs to be designed understanding that
  grid.
- This platform is open source, so any adopters are invited to contribute to the
  open source Carbon for IBM.com.

To assist adopters through this transition, Digital Design Squad (DDS) can guide
you as you are getting started. Reach out on our IBM slack channel at
[#carbon-for-ibm-dotcom](https://ibm-studios.slack.com/archives/C2PLX8GQ6).
