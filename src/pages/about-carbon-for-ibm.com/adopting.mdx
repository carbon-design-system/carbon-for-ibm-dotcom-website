<PageDescription>

Carbon is the digital expression of the IBM brand and the foundation upon which all Carbon for IBM.com components are built. As such, compliance by IBM page makers of Carbon for IBM.com ensures adherence to the IBM brand.

If you have not yet made the transition to Carbon for IBM.com, the team is here to help you.

## Overview

Carbon for IBM.com is the strategic design system for IBM web experiences. Any application using older systems like Northstar (v18), v19, or even earlier versions should make plans to adopt Carbon for IBM.com by the end of 2021.

After all applications have migrated, plans and dates will be announced for sunsetting the older systems. Reach out to us in our IBM Slack channel at [#carbon-for-ibm-dotcom](https://ibm-studios.slack.com/archives/C2PLX8GQ6) with any questions.

## Who should adopt

At this time, public facing websites are required to migrate to Carbon for IBM.com. IBM internal facing sites are not required to adopt Carbon for IBM.com.

Web apps with productive interfaces should adopt Carbon Design System, and are not required to adopt Carbon for IBM.com. If you are not sure if you should be adopting the system, please reach out to us.

## The paths to adoption

### For Marketing

Anyone producing pages published via Marketing’s Content Management System should use the templates from AEM (Adobe Experience Manager). The AEM page templates are based on Carbon, use the 2x Grid, and also use Carbon for IBM.com components.

For more information, please visit the IBM internal [Afterburner](https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/adobe/platforms/content-management) site.

### For websites or applications on v18 (Northstar), v19a, or other design systems

For IBM.com page makers who are not part of Marketing, this site explains how to get started with Carbon for IBM.com. It provides links to the code repository, the storybook, usage guidelines, and additional resources.

#### For designers

Head over to our [Get started](../../carbon/designing/) page for everything you need to design with Carbon for IBM.com. You’ll find design kits and other assets, and learn where to go for foundational guidance, usage guidance for components, and more.

#### For developers

The primary way to build experiences with Carbon and Carbon for IBM.com is using a modular approach with Node Package Manager (NPM). This would require a development re-architecture from prior design systems that are loaded over a Content Delivery Network (CDN). Applications that are built with this approach would require a module bundler in the application build process like [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/), [rollup](https://rollupjs.org/), or [parcel](https://parceljs.org/).

An alternative to module bundling would be leveraging the CDN versions of <Link to="/developing/frameworks/web-components">Carbon for IBM.com Web Components</Link> and [Carbon Web Components](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/developing/frameworks/web-components/).
