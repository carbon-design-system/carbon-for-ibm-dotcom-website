**Note:** Carbon for IBM.com is the strategic design system for IBM web experiences. Any application using older systems like Northstar (v18), v19, or even earlier versions should make plans to adopt Carbon for IBM.com by the end of 2021.  After all applications have migrated, plans and dates will be announced for sunsetting the older systems. Reach out to us in our IBM Slack channel at [#carbon-for-ibm-dotcom](https://ibm-studios.slack.com/archives/C2PLX8GQ6) with any questions.

## Choosing the right path to adoption

### For pages produced and published in Marketing's Content Management System

Carbon will be made available through the creation of pages in AEM. The use of these templates when they become available is the path to Carbon because these templates are part of a new content model and publishing tool. 

For more information, please visit internal link [Afterburner](https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/adobe).

In the interim, while these templates are being built, page owners can use the Design Guidelines to configure existing pages to have the look and feel of IBM Design Language. 

For more information, please visit [Marketing Platforms Drupal CMS website](https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/squad-pulse/marketing-platforms/drupal-cms#Links).

### For websites or applications on v18 (Northstar), v19a, or other design systems

Make plans now to migrate your site to Carbon for IBM.com. This site explains how to get started with Carbon for IBM.com. It provides links to the code repository, the storybook, usage guidelines, and additional resources. Keep in mind the following as you get started:

* Carbon and Carbon for IBM.com is built using Node Package Manager (NPM), not the Content Delivery Network (CDN), so it requires a development rewrite, unlike prior design systems.
* Carbon has a new 2x grid so everything needs to be designed understanding that grid.
* This platform is open source, so any adopters are invited to contribute to the open source Carbon for IBM.com.

To assist adopters through this transition, Digital Design Squad (DDS) can guide you as you are getting started. Reach out on our IBM slack channel at [#carbon-for-ibm-dotcom](https://ibm-studios.slack.com/archives/C2PLX8GQ6).
