## Overview

Carbon for IBM.com is for IBM teams building web experiences for the IBM.com site. It is built upon the foundational components of the Carbon Design System, with additional components and styling developed for the more editorial approach required of IBM's web pages.

The system is developed and maintained by the Digital Design Squad—a core team of designers, developers, and writers.

Carbon for IBM.com components are built with [Web Components](https://www.ibm.com/standards/carbon/web-components/?path=/story/overview-getting-started--page) and [React](https://www.ibm.com/standards/carbon/react/?path=/story/overview-getting-started--page).
