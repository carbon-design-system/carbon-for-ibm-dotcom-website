## About Carbon for IBM.com

The guidance and resources here have been developed for IBM teams building web experiences for the IBM.com site.

Carbon for IBM.com is built with Carbon at its foundation, with additional components and styling optimized for a more editorial approach that allows users to scan, read, and navigate multiple pages with comfort and ease. Our goals are to provide visual consistency and the highest quality for all IBM.com website pages.

The system is maintained by the Digital Design Squad, a core team of designers, developers, and writers. We strive to provide clear, discoverable guidance around design and development best practices to all Carbon for IBM.com adopters.

## About Carbon

The [Carbon Design System](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/) is IBM’s open source design system for products.

At its core, Carbon has universal assets–elements, components, patterns, and code–and guidance for how to design and build with them. These assets are considered fundamental in nature, which means they can be used as a base for the widest variety of situations, and extended or adapted for the specific business use cases.
